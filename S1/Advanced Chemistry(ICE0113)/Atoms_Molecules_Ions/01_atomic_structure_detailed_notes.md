# Detailed Notes on Atomic Structure
*Reference: Fundamentals of Chemistry by David Goldberg (pages 11-28)*

## 1. Historical Development of Atomic Theory

### 1.1 Early Concepts
- **Ancient Greek Philosophy**:
  - Democritus (460-370 BCE) proposed that matter consisted of indivisible particles called "atomos"
  - Aristotle rejected the atomic theory, favoring the four elements (earth, air, fire, water)
  - Aristotle's view dominated scientific thought for nearly 2,000 years

### 1.2 Foundation of Modern Atomic Theory
- **John Dalton's Atomic Theory (1803)**:
  1. Matter consists of indivisible atoms
  2. Atoms of the same element are identical in mass and properties
  3. Atoms of different elements have different masses and properties
  4. Compounds form when atoms combine in simple, whole-number ratios
  5. Chemical reactions involve the rearrangement of atoms, not their creation or destruction

### 1.3 Discovery of Subatomic Particles
- **J.J. Thomson's Experiments (1897)**:
  - Discovered electrons using cathode ray tubes
  - Proposed the "plum pudding model" - atoms as positively charged spheres with embedded electrons

- **Ernest Rutherford's Gold Foil Experiment (1911)**:
  - Alpha particles directed at thin gold foil
  - Unexpected observation: Some particles deflected at large angles
  - Conclusion: Atom contains a small, dense, positively charged nucleus
  - Proposed the "nuclear model" of the atom

- **James Chadwick (1932)**:
  - Discovered neutrons
  - Completed the basic model of atomic structure

## 2. Modern Atomic Structure

### 2.1 The Nuclear Atom
- **Nucleus**:
  - Located at the center of the atom
  - Contains protons and neutrons (collectively called nucleons)
  - Extremely small: ~10⁻¹⁵ meters in diameter
  - Contains ~99.95% of the atom's mass

- **Electron Cloud**:
  - Surrounds the nucleus
  - Electrons move in probability distributions called orbitals
  - Extends ~10⁻¹⁰ meters from the nucleus
  - Determines the atom's volume and chemical properties

### 2.2 Subatomic Particles

| Particle | Symbol | Charge | Mass (amu) | Mass (kg) | Discovery |
|----------|--------|--------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Proton   | p⁺     | +1     | 1.0073     | 1.673 × 10⁻²⁷ | Rutherford, 1919 |
| Neutron  | n⁰     | 0      | 1.0087     | 1.675 × 10⁻²⁷ | Chadwick, 1932 |
| Electron | e⁻     | -1     | 0.0005486  | 9.109 × 10⁻³¹ | Thomson, 1897 |

- **The Proton**:
  - Positively charged (+1)
  - Located in the nucleus
  - The number of protons determines the element's identity

- **The Neutron**:
  - No electric charge (neutral)
  - Located in the nucleus
  - Provides stability to the nucleus
  - Number can vary in isotopes of the same element

- **The Electron**:
  - Negatively charged (-1)
  - Located outside the nucleus
  - Mass is ~1/1836 of a proton
  - Determines chemical bonding properties
  - Occupies orbitals with specific energies

### 2.3 Atomic Number and Mass Number

- **Atomic Number (Z)**:
  - Number of protons in the nucleus
  - Determines the element's identity
  - In a neutral atom, equals the number of electrons

- **Mass Number (A)**:
  - Total number of protons and neutrons (A = Z + N)
  - Approximately equal to the atom's mass in atomic mass units

- **Nuclide Notation**:
  - ₂₀⁸⁴Pb (mass number 208, atomic number 82)
  - Alternatively: Pb-208 or lead-208

### 2.4 Isotopes

- **Definition**: Atoms of the same element (same Z) with different numbers of neutrons (different A)
- **Example**: Hydrogen has three natural isotopes:
  - ¹H (protium): 1 proton, 0 neutrons (99.985% abundance)
  - ²H (deuterium): 1 proton, 1 neutron (0.015% abundance)
  - ³H (tritium): 1 proton, 2 neutrons (trace amounts, radioactive)

- **Applications of Isotopes**:
  - **Carbon Dating**: ¹⁴C is used to date organic materials
  - **Medical Diagnostics**: ¹³¹I for thyroid imaging
  - **Nuclear Energy**: ²³⁵U for nuclear fission

### 2.5 Atomic Mass

- **Definition**: Weighted average of the masses of all naturally occurring isotopes of an element
- **Atomic Mass Unit (amu)**:
  - 1 amu = 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 atom
  - 1 amu = 1.6605 × 10⁻²⁷ kg

- **Calculating Atomic Mass**:
  - Formula: Atomic mass = Σ(isotope mass × fractional abundance)
  - Example for Chlorine:
    * ³⁵Cl: 34.97 amu (75.77% abundant)
    * ³⁷Cl: 36.97 amu (24.23% abundant)
    * Atomic mass = (34.97 × 0.7577) + (36.97 × 0.2423) = 35.45 amu

## 3. Electron Configuration

### 3.1 Bohr's Model
- **Niels Bohr (1913)**:
  - Electrons orbit the nucleus in fixed circular paths (energy levels)
  - Electrons can jump between energy levels by absorbing or emitting specific amounts of energy
  - Explains the hydrogen spectrum but fails for multi-electron atoms

### 3.2 Quantum Mechanical Model
- **Modern Understanding**:
  - Electrons exist in probability distributions (orbitals)
  - Orbitals have specific shapes and energies
  - Four quantum numbers describe each electron:
    * Principal quantum number (n): energy level (1, 2, 3, ...)
    * Angular momentum quantum number (l): orbital shape (s, p, d, f)
    * Magnetic quantum number (m₁): orbital orientation
    * Spin quantum number (m₍s)): electron spin (+1/2 or -1/2)

### 3.3 Electron Configuration Rules
- **Aufbau Principle**: Electrons fill orbitals from lowest energy to highest
- **Pauli Exclusion Principle**: No two electrons in an atom can have identical quantum numbers
- **Hund's Rule**: Electrons occupy degenerate orbitals singly before pairing up

## 4. Sizes of Atoms

### 4.1 Atomic Radius
- **Definition**: Half the distance between the nuclei of two identical bonded atoms
- **Trends in the Periodic Table**:
  - Decreases across a period (left to right)
  - Increases down a group (top to bottom)
  - Explanation: Effective nuclear charge and electron shielding effects

### 4.2 Ionic Radius
- **Cations**: Smaller than their parent atoms (loss of outer electron shell)
- **Anions**: Larger than their parent atoms (gain of electrons increases electron-electron repulsion)
- **Isoelectronic Series**: Ions with the same number of electrons
  - Example: N³⁻, O²⁻, F⁻, Ne, Na⁺, Mg²⁺, Al³⁺
  - As nuclear charge increases, ionic radius decreases

## 5. Energy Considerations in Atomic Structure

### 5.1 Ionization Energy
- **Definition**: Energy required to remove an electron from a gaseous atom or ion
- **First Ionization Energy**: Energy to remove the first electron
- **Trends**:
  - Increases across a period
  - Decreases down a group
  - Noble gases have the highest ionization energies

### 5.2 Electron Affinity
- **Definition**: Energy change when an electron is added to a gaseous atom
- **Trends**:
  - Generally becomes more negative across a period
  - Less predictable down a group
  - Halogens have the most negative electron affinities

### 5.3 Electronegativity
- **Definition**: Relative ability of an atom to attract shared electrons in a bond
- **Pauling Scale**: Common scale for electronegativity values (0.7 to 4.0)
- **Trends**:
  - Increases across a period
  - Decreases down a group
  - Fluorine is the most electronegative element (4.0)

## 6. Practical Applications and Measurements

### 6.1 Spectroscopy
- **Emission Spectra**: Unique patterns of light emitted by excited atoms
- **Absorption Spectra**: Patterns of wavelengths absorbed by atoms
- **Applications**:
  - Element identification
  - Astronomical observations
  - Medical diagnostics

### 6.2 Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM)
- Allows visualization of individual atoms
- Uses quantum tunneling effect
- Can manipulate individual atoms

### 6.3 Mass Spectrometry
- Determines isotopic abundances and atomic masses
- Works by ionizing atoms and separating them by mass-to-charge ratio

## 7. Key Equations and Relationships

1. **Number of neutrons**: N = A - Z
2. **Atomic mass calculation**: Atomic mass = Σ(isotope mass × fractional abundance)
3. **Energy of photon**: E = hν (where h is Planck's constant, ν is frequency)
4. **De Broglie wavelength**: λ = h/mv (where m is mass, v is velocity)
5. **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**: Δx·Δp ≥ h/4π
6. **Rydberg formula** (for hydrogen spectral lines): 1/λ = R(1/n₁² - 1/n₂²)
