*Based on Fundamentals of Chemistry by David Goldberg (pages 11-28)*

## 1. Introduction to Atomic Theory

### 1.1 Development of Atomic Theory
- **Dalton's Atomic Theory (1803)**
  - Matter is composed of indivisible particles called atoms
  - Atoms of the same element are identical
  - Atoms of different elements have different properties
  - Atoms combine in simple whole-number ratios to form compounds
  - Chemical reactions involve the rearrangement of atoms

- **Evolution of Atomic Theory**
  - Thomson's discovery of electrons (1897)
  - Rutherford's nuclear model (1911)
  - Bohr's quantized energy levels (1913)
  - Modern quantum mechanical model

## 2. Atomic Structure

### 2.1 Subatomic Particles
| Particle | Symbol | Charge | Mass (amu) | Location |
|----------|--------|--------|------------|----------|
| Proton   | p⁺     | +1     | 1.0073     | Nucleus  |
| Neutron  | n⁰     | 0      | 1.0087     | Nucleus  |
| Electron | e⁻     | -1     | 0.0005     | Orbitals |

### 2.2 Atomic Number and Mass Number
- **Atomic Number (Z)**: Number of protons in the nucleus
  - Defines the element's identity
  - Equal to number of electrons in a neutral atom

- **Mass Number (A)**: Sum of protons and neutrons in the nucleus
  - A = number of protons + number of neutrons

- **Isotope Notation**: ₂₀⁸⁴Pb (where 208 is mass number, 82 is atomic number)

### 2.3 Isotopes
- **Definition**: Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons
- **Examples**:
  - Hydrogen: ¹H (protium), ²H (deuterium), ³H (tritium)
  - Carbon: ¹²C, ¹³C, ¹⁴C
  - Uranium: ²³⁵U, ²³⁸U

### 2.4 Atomic Mass
- **Definition**: Weighted average mass of all naturally occurring isotopes of an element
- **Formula**: Atomic mass = Σ(isotopic mass × fractional abundance)
- **Example**:
  - Chlorine has two isotopes:
    - ³⁵Cl (75.77% abundant, mass 34.97 amu)
    - ³⁷Cl (24.23% abundant, mass 36.97 amu)
  - Atomic mass = (34.97 × 0.7577) + (36.97 × 0.2423) = 35.45 amu

## 3. The Periodic Table

### 3.1 Organization of Elements
- **Periods**: Horizontal rows (numbered 1-7)
- **Groups/Families**: Vertical columns (numbered 1-18)
- **Classification of Elements**:
  - Metals (left and center)
  - Nonmetals (upper right)
  - Metalloids (along the stair-step line)
  - Noble gases (Group 18)

### 3.2 Periodic Trends
- **Atomic Radius**: Decreases across period, increases down group
- **Ionization Energy**: Increases across period, decreases down group
- **Electronegativity**: Increases across period, decreases down group
- **Electron Affinity**: Generally increases across period, varies down group

## 4. Molecules and Compounds

### 4.1 Molecular vs. Ionic Compounds
- **Molecular Compounds**:
  - Formed between nonmetals
  - Share electrons (covalent bonding)
  - Often exist as discrete molecules
  - Example: H₂O, CO₂, CH₄

- **Ionic Compounds**:
  - Formed between metals and nonmetals
  - Transfer electrons (ionic bonding)
  - Exist as lattices of positive and negative ions
  - Example: NaCl, CaF₂, MgO

### 4.2 Chemical Formulas
- **Empirical Formula**: Simplest whole-number ratio of atoms in a compound
- **Molecular Formula**: Actual number of atoms in a molecule
- **Structural Formula**: Shows how atoms are arranged and bonded
- **Example**: Glucose
  - Empirical formula: CH₂O
  - Molecular formula: C₆H₁₂O₆
  - Structural formula: Shows hexagonal ring structure

### 4.3 Naming Compounds
- **Binary Molecular Compounds**:
  - Prefix system (mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, etc.)
  - Example: CO = carbon monoxide, CO₂ = carbon dioxide

- **Binary Ionic Compounds**:
  - Metal name + nonmetal root + "-ide"
  - Example: NaCl = sodium chloride, CaO = calcium oxide

- **Polyatomic Ions**:
  - Common polyatomic ions have specific names
  - Example: NH₄⁺ = ammonium, SO₄²⁻ = sulfate

## 5. Ions and Ionic Compounds

### 5.1 Ion Formation
- **Cation Formation**: Atoms lose electrons to form positively charged ions
  - Example: Na → Na⁺ + e⁻
  - Common for metals

- **Anion Formation**: Atoms gain electrons to form negatively charged ions
  - Example: Cl + e⁻ → Cl⁻
  - Common for nonmetals

### 5.2 Common Ions
- **Monatomic Ions**: Derived from single atoms
  - Group 1A/1: forms +1 ions (Na⁺, K⁺)
  - Group 2A/2: forms +2 ions (Mg²⁺, Ca²⁺)
  - Group 7A/17: forms -1 ions (F⁻, Cl⁻)
  - Group 6A/16: forms -2 ions (O²⁻, S²⁻)

- **Polyatomic Ions**: Composed of multiple atoms
  | Ion | Formula | Charge |
  |-----|---------|--------|
  | Ammonium | NH₄⁺ | +1 |
  | Hydroxide | OH⁻ | -1 |
  | Nitrate | NO₃⁻ | -1 |
  | Carbonate | CO₃²⁻ | -2 |
  | Sulfate | SO₄²⁻ | -2 |
  | Phosphate | PO₄³⁻ | -3 |

### 5.3 Ionic Bonding
