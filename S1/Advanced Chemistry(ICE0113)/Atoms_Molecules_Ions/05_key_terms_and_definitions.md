## Atomic Structure

### Atom
The smallest unit of an element that retains the chemical properties of that element, consisting of a nucleus surrounded by electrons.

### Subatomic Particles
- **Proton**: Positively charged particle found in the nucleus of an atom; has a relative charge of +1 and a mass of approximately 1 amu.
- **Neutron**: Neutral particle found in the nucleus of an atom; has no charge and a mass of approximately 1 amu.
- **Electron**: Negatively charged particle that orbits the nucleus; has a relative charge of -1 and a mass of approximately 1/1836 amu.

### Nucleus
The dense, central core of an atom containing protons and neutrons.

### Atomic Number (Z)
The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom; determines the element's identity.

### Mass Number (A)
The sum of the number of protons and neutrons in an atom's nucleus.

### Isotope
Atoms of the same element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.

### Atomic Mass Unit (amu)
A unit of mass equal to 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 atom; approximately 1.66 × 10⁻²⁷ kg.

### Atomic Mass
The weighted average of the masses of all naturally occurring isotopes of an element.

### Periodic Table
A tabular arrangement of the chemical elements organized by atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties.

### Orbital
A region of space around the nucleus where there is a high probability of finding an electron.

### Energy Level
A specific energy state or shell in which electrons can exist around the nucleus.

### Valence Electrons
Electrons in the outermost energy level of an atom that can participate in forming chemical bonds.

### Core Electrons
Electrons in the inner energy levels of an atom that typically do not participate in chemical bonding.

## Chemical Bonding and Molecules

### Chemical Bond
The force of attraction that holds atoms together in a molecule or compound.

### Molecule
A group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds.

### Covalent Bond
A chemical bond formed by the sharing of electron pairs between atoms.

### Single Bond
A covalent bond formed by sharing one pair of electrons.

### Double Bond
A covalent bond formed by sharing two pairs of electrons.

### Triple Bond
A covalent bond formed by sharing three pairs of electrons.

### Polar Covalent Bond
A covalent bond in which electrons are shared unequally, resulting in a partial positive charge on one atom and a partial negative charge on the other.

### Nonpolar Covalent Bond
A covalent bond in which electrons are shared equally between atoms.

### Electronegativity
A measure of an atom's ability to attract shared electrons in a chemical bond.

### Lewis Structure
A diagram that shows the bonding between atoms of a molecule and the lone pairs of electrons.

### Structural Formula
A representation of a molecule showing the arrangement of atoms and bonds.

### Molecular Formula
A chemical formula that shows the actual number of atoms of each element in a molecule.

### Empirical Formula
A chemical formula that shows the simplest whole-number ratio of atoms of each element in a compound.

### VSEPR Theory
Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion theory - a model used to predict the geometry of molecules based on the repulsion between electron pairs.

### Molecular Geometry
The three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in a molecule.

### Hybridization
The mixing of atomic orbitals to form new hybrid orbitals suitable for chemical bonding.

## Ions and Ionic Compounds

### Ion
An atom or group of atoms that has gained or lost one or more electrons, resulting in a net electric charge.

### Cation
A positively charged ion, formed when an atom loses one or more electrons.

### Anion
A negatively charged ion, formed when an atom gains one or more electrons.

### Monatomic Ion
An ion formed from a single atom.

### Polyatomic Ion
An ion composed of two or more atoms.

### Ionic Bond
A chemical bond formed by the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions.

### Ionic Compound
A chemical compound composed of cations and anions held together by ionic bonds.

### Formula Unit
The smallest electrically neutral collection of ions in an ionic compound.

### Lattice Energy
The energy released when gaseous ions combine to form a solid ionic compound.

### Hydrate
An ionic compound that has a specific number of water molecules associated with it in its crystal structure.

## Chemical Nomenclature

### Binary Compound
A compound containing only two elements.

### Binary Molecular Compound
A compound composed of two nonmetals.

### Binary Ionic Compound
A compound composed of a metal and a nonmetal.

### Oxyanion
