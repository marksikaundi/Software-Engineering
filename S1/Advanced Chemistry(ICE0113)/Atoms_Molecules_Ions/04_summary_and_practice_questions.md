*Reference: Fundamentals of Chemistry by David Goldberg (pages 11-28)*

## Summary of Key Concepts

### Atomic Structure
- **Atom**: Smallest unit of an element that retains its chemical properties
- **Subatomic Particles**:
  - Protons: Positive charge, in nucleus, determine element identity
  - Neutrons: No charge, in nucleus, provide stability
  - Electrons: Negative charge, orbit nucleus, involved in chemical bonding
- **Atomic Number (Z)**: Number of protons in the nucleus
- **Mass Number (A)**: Sum of protons and neutrons
- **Isotopes**: Atoms of same element with different numbers of neutrons
- **Atomic Mass**: Weighted average of the masses of all naturally occurring isotopes

### Molecules and Chemical Bonding
- **Molecule**: Two or more atoms chemically bonded together
- **Chemical Bond**: Force that holds atoms together in molecules/compounds
- **Covalent Bond**: Atoms share electrons to achieve stable configurations
  - Single, double, and triple bonds involve sharing 2, 4, or 6 electrons
  - Polar covalent bonds: Unequal sharing of electrons
  - Nonpolar covalent bonds: Equal sharing of electrons
- **Ionic Bond**: Complete transfer of electrons between atoms
- **Molecular Geometry**: Determined by VSEPR theory based on electron repulsion
- **Hybridization**: Mixing of atomic orbitals to form hybrid orbitals for bonding

### Ions and Ionic Compounds
- **Ion**: Atom or molecule with a net electric charge due to gaining/losing electrons
- **Cation**: Positively charged ion (lost electrons)
- **Anion**: Negatively charged ion (gained electrons)
- **Monatomic Ions**: Single atoms with a charge
- **Polyatomic Ions**: Group of atoms with a charge (e.g., NH₄⁺, SO₄²⁻)
- **Ionic Compound**: Formed from positive and negative ions held by electrostatic forces
- **Ionic Crystal**: Three-dimensional lattice of alternating positive and negative ions
- **Properties of Ionic Compounds**:
  - High melting and boiling points
  - Brittle nature
  - Conduct electricity when molten or in solution

### Chemical Nomenclature
- **Binary Molecular Compounds**: Use prefixes (di-, tri-, tetra-, etc.)
  - Example: CO₂ is carbon dioxide
- **Binary Ionic Compounds**: Metal name followed by nonmetal with -ide suffix
  - Example: NaCl is sodium chloride
- **Compounds with Transition Metals**: Indicate metal charge with Roman numerals
  - Example: FeCl₃ is iron(III) chloride
- **Polyatomic Ion Compounds**: Name cation followed by polyatomic ion name
  - Example: Ca(NO₃)₂ is calcium nitrate
- **Acids**: Based on anion name
  - Binary acids: "hydro-" prefix and "-ic acid" suffix (HCl: hydrochloric acid)
  - Oxoacids: Based on oxyanion name (-ate → -ic acid, -ite → -ous acid)
