# Molecules and Chemical Bonding
*Reference: Fundamentals of Chemistry by David Goldberg (pages 11-28)*

## 1. Introduction to Chemical Bonding

### 1.1 What is a Chemical Bond?
- **Definition**: A chemical bond is a lasting attraction between atoms that enables the formation of chemical compounds
- **Purpose**: To achieve a more stable electron configuration (typically octet structure)
- **Energy Considerations**: Bond formation releases energy (exothermic)

### 1.2 Types of Chemical Bonds
- **Ionic Bond**: Complete transfer of electrons between atoms
- **Covalent Bond**: Sharing of electrons between atoms
- **Metallic Bond**: Delocalized electrons among a lattice of metal atoms
- **Intermolecular Forces**: Weaker attractions between molecules (not true bonds)

## 2. Ionic Bonding

### 2.1 Mechanism of Ionic Bond Formation
- **Electron Transfer**: Valence electrons completely transferred from one atom to another
- **Occurs Between**: Metals (electron donors) and nonmetals (electron acceptors)
- **Driving Force**: Electronegativity difference (typically > 1.7 on Pauling scale)

### 2.2 Characteristics of Ionic Compounds
- **Structure**: Three-dimensional lattice of alternating cations and anions
- **Formula Units**: Smallest electrically neutral collection of ions (not true molecules)
- **Physical Properties**:
  - High melting and boiling points
  - Hard and brittle
  - Conduct electricity when molten or in aqueous solution
  - Usually soluble in water
  - Poor thermal and electrical conductors in solid state

### 2.3 Energy Considerations in Ionic Bonding
- **Lattice Energy**: Energy released when gaseous ions form a crystal lattice
- **Born-Haber Cycle**: Thermochemical cycle for analyzing the formation of ionic compounds
- **Factors Affecting Lattice Energy**:
  - Ion charge (higher charges = stronger attraction)
  - Ion size (smaller ions = stronger attraction)
  - Lattice arrangement

## 3. Covalent Bonding

### 3.1 Mechanism of Covalent Bond Formation
- **Electron Sharing**: Atoms share pairs of valence electrons
- **Occurs Between**: Nonmetals (similar electronegativity)
- **Driving Force**: Achievement of noble gas configuration through electron sharing

### 3.2 Types of Covalent Bonds
- **Single Bond**: One shared pair of electrons (represented by a single line: A−B)
- **Double Bond**: Two shared pairs of electrons (represented by a double line: A═B)
- **Triple Bond**: Three shared pairs of electrons (represented by a triple line: A≡B)

### 3.3 Polar vs. Nonpolar Covalent Bonds
- **Nonpolar Covalent Bond**:
  - Equal sharing of electrons
  - Occurs between atoms with identical or very similar electronegativity
  - Examples: H₂, Cl₂, F₂

- **Polar Covalent Bond**:
  - Unequal sharing of electrons (partial charges develop)
  - Occurs between atoms with different electronegativities (0.4-1.7 difference)
  - Examples: H₂O, NH₃, HCl

### 3.4 Bond Polarity and Electronegativity
- **Electronegativity Difference**:
  - 0-0.4: Nonpolar covalent bond
  - 0.4-1.7: Polar covalent bond
  - >1.7: Ionic bond (though boundaries are approximate)

- **Dipole Moment**: Measure of bond polarity (product of charge separation and distance)
  - Unit: Debye (D)
  - Direction: Points from positive to negative charge

## 4. Molecular Structure

### 4.1 Lewis Structures
- **Purpose**: Show arrangement of valence electrons in molecules
- **Rules for Drawing Lewis Structures**:
  1. Calculate total valence electrons
  2. Connect atoms with single bonds
  3. Complete octets of terminal atoms
  4. Place remaining electrons on central atom
  5. Form multiple bonds if needed

- **Exceptions to the Octet Rule**:
  - Incomplete octets: Be, B compounds
  - Expanded octets: Elements in period 3 and beyond (P, S, etc.)
  - Odd electron molecules: NO, NO₂

### 4.2 Formal Charge
- **Definition**: Charge assigned to an atom in a molecule assuming equal sharing of bonding electrons
- **Formula**: Formal Charge = Valence electrons − (Nonbonding electrons + ½ Bonding electrons)
- **Application**: Used to determine the most likely Lewis structure when multiple structures are possible

### 4.3 Resonance
- **Definition**: When a molecule can be represented by multiple Lewis structures that differ only in electron positions
- **Notation**: Double-headed arrow between resonance structures (A ↔ B)
- **Importance**: The actual structure is a hybrid of all possible resonance structures
- **Examples**: Ozone (O₃), Benzene (C₆H₆), Nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)

## 5. Molecular Geometry

### 5.1 VSEPR Theory (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion)
- **Basic Principle**: Electron pairs around a central atom arrange themselves to minimize repulsion
- **Classification**: AXₙEₘ where:
  - A = central atom
  - X = number of bonded atoms
  - E = number of lone pairs

### 5.2 Common VSEPR Arrangements

| Formula | Electron Pairs | Lone Pairs | Molecular Geometry | Examples |
|---------|---------------|------------|-------------------|----------|
| AX₂     | 2             | 0          | Linear            | CO₂, BeCl₂ |
| AX₃     | 3             | 0          | Trigonal Planar   | BF₃, SO₃ |
| AX₂E    | 3             | 1          | Bent or Angular   | SO₂ |
| AX₄     | 4             | 0          | Tetrahedral       | CH₄, CCl₄ |
| AX₃E    | 4             | 1          | Trigonal Pyramidal| NH₃, PCl₃ |
| AX₂E₂   | 4             | 2          | Bent or Angular   | H₂O, H₂S |
| AX₅     | 5             | 0          | Trigonal Bipyramidal | PCl₅ |
| AX₆     | 6             | 0          | Octahedral        | SF₆ |

### 5.3 Molecular Polarity
- **Polar Molecule**: Has a net dipole moment due to:
  - Polar bonds
  - Asymmetrical arrangement of polar bonds

- **Nonpolar Molecule**: May have polar bonds but has no net dipole moment due to:
  - No polar bonds
  - Symmetrical arrangement of polar bonds

- **Examples**:
  - Polar molecules: H₂O, NH₃, CHCl₃
  - Nonpolar molecules with polar bonds: CO₂, CCl₄, BF₃

## 6. Bond Properties

### 6.1 Bond Length
- **Definition**: Average distance between the nuclei of two bonded atoms
- **Trends**:
  - Triple bonds are shorter than double bonds, which are shorter than single bonds
  - Bond length increases as atom size increases

### 6.2 Bond Strength
- **Bond Energy**: Energy required to break a chemical bond
- **Measurement**: kJ/mol
- **Trends**:
  - Triple bonds are stronger than double bonds, which are stronger than single bonds
  - Bond energy generally decreases with increasing atom size

### 6.3 Bond Angle
- **Definition**: Angle formed between two adjacent bonds
- **Factors Affecting Bond Angles**:
  - Electronic geometry (VSEPR arrangement)
  - Lone pairs (reduce bond angles due to greater repulsion)
  - Multiple bonds (increase repulsion compared to single bonds)

## 7. Molecular Orbital Theory

### 7.1 Basic Principles
- **Atomic Orbital (AO) Overlap**: Atoms combine their atomic orbitals to form molecular orbitals
- **Types of Molecular Orbitals (MO)**:
  - Bonding MO: Lower energy than component AOs
  - Antibonding MO: Higher energy than component AOs

### 7.2 Bond Order
- **Definition**: (Number of electrons in bonding MOs - Number of electrons in antibonding MOs) ÷ 2
- **Significance**:
  - Bond order = 1: Single bond
  - Bond order = 2: Double bond
  - Bond order = 3: Triple bond
  - Fractional bond orders are possible (e.g., O₂ has bond order 2)

## 8. Hybridization

### 8.1 Types of Hybridization

| Hybridization | Geometry | Bond Angle | Examples |
|---------------|----------|------------|----------|
| sp            | Linear   | 180°       | BeCl₂, CO₂ |
| sp²           | Trigonal Planar | 120° | BF₃, C₂H₄, benzene |
| sp³           | Tetrahedral | 109.5°  | CH₄, NH₃, H₂O |
| sp³d          | Trigonal Bipyramidal | 120°, 90° | PCl₅ |
| sp³d²         | Octahedral | 90°      | SF₆ |

### 8.2 Examples of Hybridization
- **Methane (CH₄)**: Carbon uses sp³ hybridization
- **Ethylene (C₂H₄)**: Carbon uses sp² hybridization, with p orbitals forming π bond
- **Acetylene (C₂H₂)**: Carbon uses sp hybridization, with two p orbitals forming two π bonds
- **Benzene (C₆H₆)**: All carbons are sp² hybridized with delocalized π bonds

## 9. Molecules and Chemical Nomenclature

### 9.1 Binary Molecular Compounds
- **Naming Rules**:
  1. First element named normally
  2. Second element given -ide suffix
  3. Greek prefixes indicate the number of atoms (mono-, di-, tri-, etc.)

- **Examples**:
  - CO: carbon monoxide
  - CO₂: carbon dioxide
  - N₂O₄: dinitrogen tetroxide

### 9.2 Acids
- **Binary Acids** (H + nonmetal):
  - When dissolved in water: "hydro" + root + "ic acid"
  - Example: HCl in water is hydrochloric acid

- **Oxoacids** (H + polyatomic ion containing oxygen):
  - "-ic acid" for common form
