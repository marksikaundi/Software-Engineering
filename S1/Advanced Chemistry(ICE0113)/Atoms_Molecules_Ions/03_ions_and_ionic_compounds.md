# Ions and Ionic Compounds
*Reference: Fundamentals of Chemistry by David Goldberg (pages 11-28)*

## 1. Introduction to Ions

### 1.1 Definition and Formation
- **Ion**: An atom or molecule that has gained or lost one or more electrons, resulting in a net electric charge
- **Ionization**: The process of converting an atom or molecule into an ion
- **Driving Forces for Ionization**:
  - Achieving noble gas electron configuration
  - Electrostatic interactions
  - Environmental factors (solvent, temperature, etc.)

### 1.2 Types of Ions

- **Cations**: Positively charged ions (lost electrons)
  - Formed primarily by metals
  - Named the same as parent element (e.g., Na → Na⁺ = sodium ion)
  - Smaller than parent atom due to:
    * Loss of outer electron shell
    * Increased effective nuclear charge

- **Anions**: Negatively charged ions (gained electrons)
  - Formed primarily by nonmetals
  - Named with "-ide" suffix (e.g., Cl → Cl⁻ = chloride ion)
  - Larger than parent atom due to:
    * Increased electron-electron repulsion
    * Decreased effective nuclear charge

### 1.3 Ion Stability and Octet Rule

- **Octet Rule**: Atoms tend to gain, lose, or share electrons to achieve a stable configuration of eight electrons in their valence shell
- **Noble Gas Configuration**: Ions often form to achieve the electron configuration of the nearest noble gas
- **Common Cation Formations**:
  - Group 1/IA elements (Li, Na, K): Lose 1 electron (1+ charge)
  - Group 2/IIA elements (Mg, Ca, Ba): Lose 2 electrons (2+ charge)

- **Common Anion Formations**:
  - Group 17/VIIA elements (F, Cl, Br, I): Gain 1 electron (1- charge)
  - Group 16/VIA elements (O, S, Se): Gain 2 electrons (2- charge)
  - Group 15/VA elements (N, P): Gain 3 electrons (3- charge)
