# Gas Laws Flashcards

## Basic Concepts

**Q: What are the four main variables that describe the state of a gas?**
A: Pressure (P), Volume (V), Temperature (T), and Amount (n in moles)

**Q: What units are typically used to express gas pressure?**
A: Atmospheres (atm), pascals (Pa), millimeters of mercury (mmHg), and torr

**Q: What is standard temperature and pressure (STP)?**
A: 0°C (273.15 K) and 1 atmosphere of pressure

**Q: What is the molar volume of an ideal gas at STP?**
A: 22.4 liters per mole

## Gas Laws

**Q: State Boyle's Law**
A: At constant temperature, the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to its pressure (P₁V₁ = P₂V₂)

**Q: State Charles's Law**
A: At constant pressure, the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature (V₁/T₁ = V₂/T₂)

**Q: State Gay-Lussac's Law**
A: At constant volume, the pressure of a gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature (P₁/T₁ = P₂/T₂)

**Q: State Avogadro's Law**
A: At constant temperature and pressure, the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles of gas (V₁/n₁ = V₂/n₂)

**Q: Write the Ideal Gas Law equation and define all variables**
A: PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is number of moles, R is the universal gas constant, and T is absolute temperature in Kelvin

**Q: What is the value of the universal gas constant R in L·atm/mol·K?**
A: R = 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K

**Q: State Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures**
A: The total pressure of a mixture of gases equals the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases (Ptotal = P₁ + P₂ + P₃ + ...)

## Kinetic Molecular Theory

**Q: List the five main postulates of the Kinetic Molecular Theory**
A: 1) Gases consist of particles in continuous random motion; 2) Gas particles have negligible volume; 3) Gas particles have no attractive/repulsive forces; 4) Collisions between molecules are elastic; 5) Average kinetic energy is proportional to absolute temperature

**Q: How does the Kinetic Molecular Theory explain gas pressure?**
A: Gas pressure results from collisions between gas particles and the walls of their container

**Q: According to KMT, what happens to molecular motion as temperature increases?**
A: As temperature increases, the average kinetic energy and speed of molecules increase

## Real Gases vs Ideal Gases

**Q: Under what conditions do real gases deviate most from ideal gas behavior?**
A: At high pressures and low temperatures

**Q: What two factors cause deviations from ideal gas behavior?**
A: 1) Actual gas molecules have volume; 2) Intermolecular attractions exist between real gas molecules

**Q: What equation accounts for the behavior of real gases?**
A: The Van der Waals equation: (P + a(n/V)²)(V - nb) = nRT

## Diffusion and Effusion

**Q: Define diffusion in gases**
A: The process by which gases mix with each other due to random molecular motion

**Q: Define effusion**
A: The process by which gas molecules escape through a tiny hole in their container

**Q: State Graham's Law of Effusion**
A: The rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass (rate₁/rate₂ = √(M₂/M₁))

**Q: Which gas would effuse faster: O₂ or He?**
A: Helium (He) would effuse faster because it has a lower molar mass than oxygen (O₂)

## Calculations and Applications

**Q: How do you calculate the density of a gas using the Ideal Gas Law?**
A: Density (d) = PM/RT, where M is the molar mass of the gas

**Q: What happens to the volume of a gas if you double the pressure while keeping temperature constant?**
A: The volume is reduced to half its original value

**Q: What happens to the pressure of a gas if you double its absolute temperature while keeping volume constant?**
A: The pressure doubles

**Q: If the temperature of a gas increases from 300K to 600K at constant pressure, what happens to its volume?**
A: The volume doubles
