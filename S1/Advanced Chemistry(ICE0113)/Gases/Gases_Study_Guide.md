## Introduction to Gases

Gases are one of the three common states of matter. Unlike solids and liquids, gases:
- Have no definite shape or volume
- Expand to fill their container
- Have particles that move rapidly and randomly
- Can be compressed easily
- Have low density compared to solids and liquids

The behavior of gases is described by several gas laws, which relate the pressure, volume, temperature, and amount of a gas.

## Gas Laws

### Boyle's Law

**Principle**: At constant temperature, the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to its pressure.

**Mathematical expression**: P₁V₁ = P₂V₂

**Key concepts**:
- When pressure increases, volume decreases proportionally
- When pressure decreases, volume increases proportionally
- The product of pressure and volume is constant at a fixed temperature and mass

### Charles's Law

**Principle**: At constant pressure, the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature.

**Mathematical expression**: V₁/T₁ = V₂/T₂

**Key concepts**:
- When temperature increases, volume increases proportionally
- When temperature decreases, volume decreases proportionally
- Temperature must be in Kelvin units (absolute temperature)

### Gay-Lussac's Law

**Principle**: At constant volume, the pressure of a gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature.

**Mathematical expression**: P₁/T₁ = P₂/T₂

**Key concepts**:
- When temperature increases, pressure increases proportionally
- When temperature decreases, pressure decreases proportionally
- Temperature must be in Kelvin units

### Avogadro's Law

**Principle**: At constant temperature and pressure, the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles of gas.

**Mathematical expression**: V₁/n₁ = V₂/n₂

**Key concepts**:
- Equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure contain equal numbers of molecules
- Standard molar volume of any gas at STP (0°C, 1 atm) is approximately 22.4 L/mol

### Ideal Gas Law

**Principle**: Combines all the gas laws into a single equation that relates pressure, volume, temperature, and amount of gas.

**Mathematical expression**: PV = nRT

Where:
- P = pressure (usually in atm)
- V = volume (usually in liters)
- n = number of moles of gas
- R = universal gas constant (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K)
- T = temperature (in Kelvin)

**Key concepts**:
- This law assumes gases behave ideally
- Useful for calculating changes in any of the four variables when the other three are known
- Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP) conditions: 0°C (273.15 K) and 1 atm

## Kinetic Molecular Theory

The Kinetic Molecular Theory explains the behavior of gases at the molecular level. Its key postulates are:

1. Gases consist of a large number of molecules that are in continuous, random motion
2. The volume of gas molecules is negligible compared to the total volume of the gas
3. There are no attractive or repulsive forces between gas molecules
4. Collisions between molecules are perfectly elastic (no energy loss)
5. The average kinetic energy of gas molecules is proportional to the absolute temperature

**Implications**:
- Gas pressure results from collisions of molecules with container walls
- Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of molecules
- At the same temperature, all gas molecules have the same average kinetic energy

## Gas Mixtures and Partial Pressures

### Dalton's Law

**Principle**: The total pressure of a mixture of gases equals the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases.

**Mathematical expression**: P_total = P₁ + P₂ + P₃ + ...

Where P₁, P₂, P₃, etc. are the partial pressures of each gas in the mixture.

**Key concepts**:
- Partial pressure of a gas = pressure it would exert if it were alone in the container
- Each gas in a mixture behaves independently
- Partial pressure of a gas = mole fraction × total pressure
  - P₁ = X₁ × P_total where X₁ is the mole fraction of gas 1

## Real Gases

**Deviations from ideal behavior**:
- Real gas molecules have volume
- Real gas molecules experience intermolecular forces
- These deviations are most significant at high pressures and low temperatures

### Van der Waals Equation

**Mathematical expression**: (P + a(n/V)²)(V - nb) = nRT

Where:
- a and b are constants specific to each gas
- a accounts for intermolecular attractive forces
- b accounts for the volume of gas molecules

## Gas Diffusion and Effusion

**Diffusion**: The process by which gases mix with one another due to random molecular motion.

**Effusion**: The process by which gas molecules escape through a tiny hole in a container.

### Graham's Law

**Principle**: The rate of effusion or diffusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass.

**Mathematical expression**: rate₁/rate₂ = √(M₂/M₁)

Where M₁ and M₂ are the molar masses of the gases.

**Key concepts**:
- Lighter gas molecules move faster than heavier ones at the same temperature
- The average speed of gas molecules is inversely proportional to the square root of their molar mass

## Practice Problems

1. A gas occupies 245 mL at 0.970 atm. What will be its volume at 0.760 atm if temperature remains constant?

2. A gas occupies 3.8 L at 25°C. What will be its volume at 100°C if pressure remains constant?

3. A sample of helium occupies 3.8 L at 25°C and 1.0 atm. How many moles of helium are present?

4. A mixture contains 0.30 mol of N₂, 0.50 mol of O₂, and 0.20 mol of CO₂. If the total pressure is 2.0 atm, what is the partial pressure of each gas?

5. Compare the rates of effusion of hydrogen (H₂) and oxygen (O₂) at the same temperature and pressure.

## Common Misconceptions

1. **Misconception**: Heavier gases always sink and lighter gases always rise.
   **Correction**: While molecular weight affects gas behavior, mixing and diffusion often overcome this effect, especially in enclosed spaces.

2. **Misconception**: Gas pressure is created by molecules pushing against each other.
   **Correction**: Gas pressure results from molecules colliding with container walls, not from interactions between molecules.

3. **Misconception**: The Ideal Gas Law works perfectly for all gases.
   **Correction**: Real gases deviate from ideal behavior, especially at high pressures and low temperatures.

4. **Misconception**: Volume and pressure have a simple inverse relationship under all conditions.
   **Correction**: This is only true when temperature and amount of gas are constant (Boyle's Law).
