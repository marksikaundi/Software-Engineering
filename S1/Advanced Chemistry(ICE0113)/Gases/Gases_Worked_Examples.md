# Worked Examples: Gas Laws and Calculations

## Boyle's Law Examples

### Example 1
**Problem**: A gas has a volume of 450 mL at a pressure of 740 mmHg. What will be the volume of the gas at 1.2 atm pressure if the temperature remains constant? (1 atm = 760 mmHg)

**Solution**:
1. Convert all units to the same system:
   - 740 mmHg = 740 mmHg ÷ 760 mmHg/atm = 0.9737 atm
   - Initial conditions: P₁ = 0.9737 atm, V₁ = 450 mL
   - Final conditions: P₂ = 1.2 atm, V₂ = ?

2. Apply Boyle's Law:
   - P₁V₁ = P₂V₂
   - V₂ = (P₁V₁)/P₂
   - V₂ = (0.9737 atm × 450 mL)/(1.2 atm)
   - V₂ = 365.1 mL

**Answer**: The volume will be 365 mL at 1.2 atm.

### Example 2
**Problem**: A sample of nitrogen gas occupies 3.5 L at 1.5 atm. If the pressure is increased to 4.5 atm while keeping the temperature constant, what will be the new volume?

**Solution**:
1. Given:
   - Initial conditions: P₁ = 1.5 atm, V₁ = 3.5 L
   - Final conditions: P₂ = 4.5 atm, V₂ = ?

2. Apply Boyle's Law:
   - P₁V₁ = P₂V₂
   - V₂ = (P₁V₁)/P₂
   - V₂ = (1.5 atm × 3.5 L)/(4.5 atm)

**Answer**: The new volume will be 1.17 L.

## Charles's Law Examples

### Example 1
**Problem**: A gas occupies 2.8 L at 25°C. What will be its volume at 95°C if the pressure remains constant?

**Solution**:
1. Convert temperatures to Kelvin:
   - T₁ = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K

## Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures Examples

### Example 1
**Problem**: A gas mixture contains nitrogen (N₂), oxygen (O₂), and argon (Ar). If the partial pressures are 0.756 atm, 0.202 atm, and 0.009 atm respectively, what is the total pressure of the mixture?

**Solution**:
1. Apply Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures:
   - P_total = P_N₂ + P_O₂ + P_Ar
   - P_total = 0.756 atm + 0.202 atm + 0.009 atm
   - P_total = 0.967 atm

**Answer**: The total pressure of the gas mixture is 0.967 atm.

### Example 2
**Problem**: A gas mixture has a total pressure of 1.50 atm and contains 20.0% helium, 45.0% neon, and 35.0% argon by mole. Calculate the partial pressure of each gas.

**Solution**:
1. The partial pressure of a gas is equal to its mole fraction multiplied by the total pressure:
   - P_He = X_He × P_total = 0.200 × 1.50 atm = 0.300 atm
   - P_Ne = X_Ne × P_total = 0.450 × 1.50 atm = 0.675 atm
   - P_Ar = X_Ar × P_total = 0.350 × 1.50 atm = 0.525 atm

2. Verify using Dalton's Law:
   - P_total = P_He + P_Ne + P_Ar
   - 1.50 atm = 0.300 atm + 0.675 atm + 0.525 atm
   - 1.50 atm = 1.50 atm ✓

**Answer**: The partial pressures are: P_He = 0.300 atm, P_Ne = 0.675 atm, P_Ar = 0.525 atm

## Graham's Law of Diffusion and Effusion Examples

### Example 1
**Problem**: Compare the rates of effusion of hydrogen (H₂) and carbon dioxide (CO₂) at the same temperature and pressure.

**Solution**:
1. Find the molar masses:
   - Molar mass of H₂ = 2.016 g/mol
   - Molar mass of CO₂ = 44.01 g/mol

2. Apply Graham's Law:
   - rate_H₂/rate_CO₂ = √(M_CO₂/M_H₂)
   - rate_H₂/rate_CO₂ = √(44.01 g/mol / 2.016 g/mol)
   - rate_H₂/rate_CO₂ = √21.83
   - rate_H₂/rate_CO₂ = 4.67

**Answer**: Hydrogen effuses approximately 4.67 times faster than carbon dioxide.

### Example 2
**Problem**: If it takes 30 seconds for a certain amount of nitrogen (N₂) to effuse through a pinhole, how long would it take for the same amount of methane (CH₄) to effuse under the same conditions?

**Solution**:
1. Find the molar masses:
   - Molar mass of N₂ = 28.014 g/mol
   - Molar mass of CH₄ = 16.043 g/mol

2. Apply Graham's Law to find the ratio of times:
   - t_CH₄/t_N₂ = √(M_CH₄/M_N₂)
   - t_CH₄/t_N₂ = √(16.043 g/mol / 28.014 g/mol)
   - t_CH₄/t_N₂ = √0.5726
   - t_CH₄/t_N₂ = 0.7567

3. Calculate the time for CH₄:
   - t_CH₄ = t_N₂ × 0.7567
   - t_CH₄ = 30 seconds × 0.7567
   - t_CH₄ = 22.7 seconds

**Answer**: It would take approximately 22.7 seconds for methane to effuse.

## Combined Gas Law Examples

### Example 1
**Problem**: A sample of gas has a volume of 250 mL at 1.2 atm and 25°C. What will be its volume at 0.90 atm and 50°C?

**Solution**:
1. Convert temperatures to Kelvin:
   - T₁ = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K
   - T₂ = 50°C + 273.15 = 323.15 K

   - Initial conditions: P₁ = 1.2 atm, V₁ = 250 mL, T₁ = 298.15 K
   - Final conditions: P₂ = 0.90 atm, V₂ = ?, T₂ = 323.15 K

3. Apply the Combined Gas Law:
   - (P₁V₁)/T₁ = (P₂V₂)/T₂
   - V₂ = (P₁V₁T₂)/(P₂T₁)
   - V₂ = (1.2 atm × 250 mL × 323.15 K)/(0.90 atm × 298.15 K)
   - V₂ = 361 mL

**Answer**: The new volume will be 361 mL.

## Gas Density and Molar Mass Examples

### Example 1
**Problem**: A gas has a density of 1.96 g/L at 1.5 atm and 27°C. Calculate its molar mass.

**Solution**:
1. Convert temperature to Kelvin:
   - T = 27°C + 273.15 = 300.15 K

2. Use the formula derived from the ideal gas law:
   - M = dRT/P
   - M = (1.96 g/L × 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K × 300.15 K)/1.5 atm
   - M = 32.1 g/mol

**Answer**: The molar mass of the gas is 32.1 g/mol.
