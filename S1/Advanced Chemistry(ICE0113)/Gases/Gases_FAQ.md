# Frequently Asked Questions: Gases

## Basic Concepts

### Q: Why do gases fill their entire container while liquids and solids don't?
**A:** Gas particles have much higher kinetic energy than particles in liquids or solids. This high energy allows gas molecules to overcome the intermolecular forces that would otherwise keep them together, causing them to move rapidly in random directions. With no significant attractive forces between them, gas particles spread out to occupy all available space.

### Q: Why does a gas exert pressure on its container?
**A:** Gas pressure results from countless collisions of gas molecules against the container walls. Each collision transfers momentum to the wall, and the sum of these momentum transfers per unit area is what we measure as pressure.

### Q: Why must gas temperatures be expressed in Kelvin for gas law calculations?
**A:** Gas laws relate volume, pressure, or other properties to the absolute temperature. The Kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale that starts at absolute zero (the theoretical point where molecular motion ceases). Using Celsius or Fahrenheit would lead to mathematical inconsistencies because these scales don't start at zero molecular motion.

## Gas Laws

### Q: When would I use the Combined Gas Law versus the Ideal Gas Law?
**A:** Use the Combined Gas Law (P₁V₁/T₁ = P₂V₂/T₂) when dealing with a fixed amount of gas undergoing changes in pressure, volume, and temperature. Use the Ideal Gas Law (PV = nRT) when you need to incorporate the amount of gas (moles) in your calculations or when you're working with different gases.

### Q: What's the difference between Dalton's Law and the Ideal Gas Law?
**A:** Dalton's Law specifically addresses mixtures of gases, stating that the total pressure equals the sum of partial pressures. The Ideal Gas Law describes the relationship between pressure, volume, temperature, and amount for any ideal gas, whether pure or in a mixture.

### Q: Why does the Ideal Gas Law work better at high temperatures and low pressures?
**A:** At high temperatures, gas molecules have more kinetic energy, making intermolecular forces relatively less significant. At low pressures, gas molecules are farther apart, reducing both the effects of molecular volume and intermolecular attractions. Both conditions make the gas behavior closer to the assumptions of the Ideal Gas Law.

## Real-World Applications

### Q: How do the gas laws apply to breathing?
**A:** When you inhale, your diaphragm contracts and moves downward, increasing the volume of your lungs. According to Boyle's Law, this volume increase causes a pressure decrease in the lungs, making it lower than atmospheric pressure. This pressure difference causes air to flow into the lungs. When you exhale, the opposite occurs.

### Q: Why do aerosol cans have warnings about not exposing them to high temperatures?
**A:** According to Gay-Lussac's Law, when a gas's temperature increases at constant volume, its pressure increases proportionally. Aerosol cans have fixed volume, so heating them causes the pressure inside to increase dramatically, potentially exceeding the can's structural limits and causing an explosion.

### Q: How do weather balloons work with respect to gas laws?
**A:** Weather balloons are filled with helium or hydrogen gas. As the balloon rises in the atmosphere, the external pressure decreases. According to Boyle's Law, the volume of the gas inside the balloon increases as the external pressure decreases. This is why weather balloons expand dramatically as they rise to higher altitudes.

## Common Misconceptions

### Q: Is it true that gases always completely mix with each other?
**A:** While gases do tend to mix due to diffusion, complete mixing takes time and depends on factors like temperature, molecular masses, and physical barriers. In some cases, gases with very different densities may temporarily stratify, especially in still conditions.

### Q: Do all gases behave ideally?
**A:** No. Real gases deviate from ideal behavior to varying degrees, especially at high pressures and low temperatures. These conditions increase the significance of molecular volume and intermolecular forces, which are factors the Ideal Gas Law ignores.

### Q: If I double the number of gas molecules in a container, will the pressure always double?
**A:** This is true only if the temperature and volume remain constant, following Avogadro's Law. If other parameters change simultaneously, different gas laws would apply to predict the new pressure.

## Calculations and Problem-Solving

### Q: How do I determine which gas law to use for a specific problem?
**A:** Look at which variables are changing and which are constant:
- Pressure and volume changing, temperature and moles constant: Use Boyle's Law
- Volume and temperature changing, pressure and moles constant: Use Charles's Law
- Pressure and temperature changing, volume and moles constant: Use Gay-Lussac's Law
- Pressure, volume, and temperature changing, moles constant: Use the Combined Gas Law
- Need to include the amount of gas (moles): Use the Ideal Gas Law

### Q: How do I convert between different pressure units?
**A:** Use these conversion factors:
- 1 atm = 760 mmHg = 760 torr
- 1 atm = 101.325 kPa
- 1 atm = 14.7 psi
- 1 bar = 0.987 atm
- 1 Pa = 0.00000987 atm

### Q: Why do some gas law problems give unexpected answers?
**A:** Common errors include:
1. Not converting temperature to Kelvin
2. Using incorrect units for pressure or volume
3. Not accounting for all gases in a mixture
4. Assuming ideal behavior for gases under extreme conditions
5. Making calculation errors when rearranging formulas

## Experimental Considerations

### Q: Why is water vapor often ignored in gas collection over water?
**A:** It's not ignored but accounted for differently. When collecting gases over water, the total pressure is the sum of the desired gas pressure and water vapor pressure. To find the pressure of just the collected gas, you subtract the water vapor pressure (which depends on temperature) from the total pressure measured.

### Q: How can I determine the molar mass of an unknown gas experimentally?
**A:** You can use the Ideal Gas Law to find molar mass by measuring the density of the gas at a known temperature and pressure. The formula M = dRT/P relates density (d), gas constant (R), temperature (T), pressure (P), and molar mass (M).

### Q: How is the kinetic molecular theory verified experimentally?
**A:** Experiments measuring gas diffusion rates, pressure-volume relationships, and temperature effects on gas behavior all provide evidence supporting the kinetic molecular theory. Modern techniques like spectroscopy and molecular beam experiments provide direct measurements of molecular speeds and collision frequencies.
