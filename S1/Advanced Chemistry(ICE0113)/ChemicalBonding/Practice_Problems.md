6. For each pair of elements, determine the type of bond that would form (ionic, polar covalent, or nonpolar covalent) based on electronegativity differences:
   - Na and Cl
   - C and O
   - N and H
   - F and F
   - K and F
   - C and S

7. Calculate the percent ionic character for the following bonds using electronegativity values:
   - H-F (H = 2.1, F = 4.0)
   - C-O (C = 2.5, O = 3.5)

   - NaCl
   - H₂O
   - Cu
   - CO₂
   - MgCl₂
   - CH₄
   - Fe
   - CaO

9. Explain how the type of bonding in a substance affects its physical properties. Give specific examples for each type of bonding.

10. Why do ionic compounds typically have high melting points compared to covalent compounds?

## Intermolecular Forces

11. Identify the strongest intermolecular force present in each substance:

    - CH₄
    - H₂O
    - NH₃
    - HF
    - CH₃CH₂CH₃

13. Why does water have a higher boiling point than H₂S, even though sulfur has a higher molecular weight than oxygen?

## Exceptions to the Octet Rule

14. Draw the Lewis structures for the following molecules that violate the octet rule:
    - BCl₃
    - PCl₅
    - SF₆
    - NO

15. Explain why some atoms can expand their octet while others cannot.

17. Predict the hybridization of the central atom in each of the following molecules:
    - BeCl₂
    - BF₃
    - CH₄
    - PCl₅
    - SF₆

18. For the reaction: H₂ + Cl₂ → 2HCl
    - Describe the changes in bonding that occur
    - Explain whether the process is endothermic or exothermic based on bond energies
    - Calculate the enthalpy change using bond energy values

19. Using molecular orbital theory, explain why the O₂ molecule is paramagnetic.

20. Compare and contrast the bond in CO with the bond in N₂. Why does CO have a stronger bond, even though N₂ has a triple bond?
