18. Draw the Lewis structure for CO₃²⁻ and explain why resonance structures are necessary.

19. Describe how bond polarity affects the physical properties of a substance.

20. Explain why ionic compounds conduct electricity when dissolved in water but not in their solid state.

## Problem Solving Questions

21. Draw the Lewis structure for CH₃OH (methanol) and identify all bond angles.

22. For the molecule SF₆:
    - Draw the Lewis structure
    - Determine the electron-pair geometry
    - Determine the molecular geometry
    - Identify the hybridization of the central atom
    - Is the molecule polar or nonpolar? Explain.

23. Arrange the following compounds in order of increasing boiling point and explain your reasoning: CH₄, CH₃CH₃, CH₃CH₂CH₃.

24. Calculate the formal charges on all atoms in the nitrate ion (NO₃⁻).

25. Compare and contrast metallic bonding with covalent and ionic bonding.

## Answer Key

1. C) Ionic bond
2. C) CO₂
3. B) Trigonal bipyramidal
4. B) CCl₄
5. C) Hydrogen bonding
6. A) 0
7. B) sp²
8. B) NaCl
9. B) 104.5°
10. C) Covalent bonding
11. True
12. False
13. True
14. True
15. True
16. Electron-pair geometry considers all electron pairs (bonding and lone), while molecular geometry only considers the arrangement of atoms.
17. NH₃ has one lone pair on nitrogen, which pushes the three bonding pairs into a pyramidal arrangement. BF₃ has no lone pairs on boron, allowing the three bonding pairs to arrange in a planar configuration.
18. (Drawing would show a central carbon with double bond to one oxygen and single bonds to two oxygen atoms with negative charges. Resonance structures distribute the negative charge equally among all oxygen atoms.)
19. (Answer would discuss how polar bonds lead to dipole-dipole interactions, affecting properties like boiling point, solubility, etc.)
20. (Answer would explain how ions are fixed in the crystal lattice in solid state but become mobile in aqueous solution.)
