## Introduction to Chemical Bonding

Chemical bonding is the process by which atoms combine to form compounds. The type of bond formed depends on the properties of the participating atoms, particularly their electron configurations. Atoms bond to achieve stability, often by attaining an electron configuration similar to that of a noble gas (octet rule).

**Key Concept**: Atoms bond to achieve a more stable electron configuration, usually by filling their valence (outermost) shell.

## Types of Chemical Bonds

### Ionic Bonding

Ionic bonds form between metals and nonmetals with a large difference in electronegativity (typically > 1.7).

**Characteristics of Ionic Bonding:**
- Complete transfer of valence electrons from metal to nonmetal
- Formation of positively charged cations (metals) and negatively charged anions (nonmetals)
- Strong electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions
- Forms crystalline lattice structures
- Typically high melting and boiling points
- Conducts electricity when dissolved in water or melted

**Example**: NaCl (Sodium Chloride)
- Na (metal) loses one electron to become Na+ (sodium cation)
- Cl (nonmetal) gains one electron to become Cl- (chloride anion)
- Electrostatic attraction between Na+ and Cl- forms the ionic bond

### Covalent Bonding

Covalent bonds form between nonmetals with similar electronegativities through the sharing of electrons.

**Characteristics of Covalent Bonding:**
- Sharing of electron pairs between atoms
- Forms discrete molecules
- Generally lower melting and boiling points than ionic compounds
- Generally does not conduct electricity (except in some cases)

**Types of Covalent Bonds:**
1. **Single Bonds**: Sharing of one electron pair (e.g., H-H in H₂)
2. **Double Bonds**: Sharing of two electron pairs (e.g., O=O in O₂)
3. **Triple Bonds**: Sharing of three electron pairs (e.g., N≡N in N₂)
4. **Nonpolar Covalent Bonds**: Equal sharing of electron pairs (e.g., H₂, Cl₂)
5. **Polar Covalent Bonds**: Unequal sharing of electron pairs (e.g., H-Cl)
6. **Coordinate Covalent (Dative) Bonds**: Both electrons in a shared pair come from the same atom

### Metallic Bonding

Metallic bonds form between atoms of metallic elements.

**Characteristics of Metallic Bonding:**
- Valence electrons are delocalized and shared among all metal atoms in the structure
- Forms a "sea of electrons" surrounding positive metal ions
- Explains properties like electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, malleability, and ductility
- Typically has a close-packed structure

**Example**: Copper, Iron, Aluminum

## Electronegativity and Bond Polarity

**Electronegativity**: The ability of an atom to attract shared electrons in a chemical bond.

- Increases from left to right across a period on the periodic table
- Decreases from top to bottom within a group
- Fluorine is the most electronegative element (EN = 4.0)
- Francium is the least electronegative element (EN = 0.7)

**Bond Polarity**:
- **Nonpolar Bond**: Electronegativity difference < 0.4
- **Polar Bond**: Electronegativity difference between 0.4 and 1.7
- **Ionic Bond**: Electronegativity difference > 1.7

**Dipole Moment**: A measure of the polarity of a bond, represented by an arrow pointing from the positive to the negative end of the bond.

**Molecular Polarity**: Depends on both bond polarities and molecular geometry.
- Symmetrical arrangement of bonds can cancel out dipoles, resulting in a nonpolar molecule (e.g., CO₂)
- Asymmetrical arrangement results in a polar molecule (e.g., H₂O)

## Lewis Structures

Lewis structures are diagrams that show the bonding between atoms of a molecule and the lone pairs of electrons that may exist in the molecule.

**Steps to Drawing Lewis Structures:**
1. Count the total number of valence electrons in the molecule/ion
2. Identify the central atom (usually the least electronegative atom, excluding hydrogen)
3. Connect atoms with single bonds
4. Complete octets of outer atoms (except H, which needs 2 electrons)
5. Place remaining electrons on the central atom
6. If the central atom doesn't have an octet, form multiple bonds by moving lone pairs from outer atoms to create shared pairs

**Examples**:
- H₂O: O is the central atom with 2 lone pairs and 2 single bonds to H atoms
- CO₂: C is the central atom with double bonds to each O atom
- NH₃: N is the central atom with 1 lone pair and 3 single bonds to H atoms

**Exceptions to the Octet Rule:**
1. **Incomplete Octets**: Atoms with fewer than 8 electrons (e.g., BH₃)
2. **Expanded Octets**: Atoms with more than 8 electrons (e.g., PCl₅, SF₆)
3. **Odd-Electron Molecules**: Molecules with an odd number of electrons (e.g., NO, NO₂)

## VSEPR Theory and Molecular Geometry

VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory predicts the three-dimensional shape of molecules based on the repulsion between electron pairs.

**Key Principles:**
- Electron pairs (bonding and lone pairs) repel each other
- Electron pairs arrange themselves to minimize repulsion
- Lone pairs take up more space than bonding pairs

**Common Molecular Geometries:**

1. **Two Electron Pairs**:
   - Linear geometry (e.g., BeCl₂, CO₂)
   - Bond angle: 180°

2. **Three Electron Pairs**:
   - Trigonal planar (e.g., BF₃) - no lone pairs
   - Bent/Angular (e.g., SO₂) - with lone pairs
   - Bond angles: 120° (ideal)

3. **Four Electron Pairs**:
   - Tetrahedral (e.g., CH₄) - no lone pairs
   - Trigonal pyramidal (e.g., NH₃) - one lone pair
   - Bent/Angular (e.g., H₂O) - two lone pairs
   - Bond angles: 109.5° (ideal tetrahedral)

4. **Five Electron Pairs**:
   - Trigonal bipyramidal (e.g., PCl₅) - no lone pairs
   - See-saw (e.g., SF₄) - one lone pair
   - T-shaped (e.g., ClF₃) - two lone pairs
   - Linear (e.g., XeF₂) - three lone pairs

5. **Six Electron Pairs**:
   - Octahedral (e.g., SF₆) - no lone pairs
   - Square pyramidal (e.g., BrF₅) - one lone pair
   - Square planar (e.g., XeF₄) - two lone pairs

## Intermolecular Forces

Intermolecular forces are attractions between molecules that affect physical properties like boiling point, melting point, and solubility.

**Types of Intermolecular Forces:**

1. **Dispersion Forces (London Forces)**
   - Weakest type of intermolecular force
   - Present in all molecules
   - Result from temporary dipoles
   - Strength increases with molecular size and surface area
   - Example: interactions between nonpolar molecules like CH₄ or Cl₂

2. **Dipole-Dipole Interactions**
   - Occur between polar molecules
   - Stronger than dispersion forces
   - Example: HCl molecules aligning so the partially positive H is attracted to the partially negative Cl of another molecule

3. **Hydrogen Bonding**
   - Special case of dipole-dipole interactions
   - Occurs when H is bonded to highly electronegative atoms (N, O, F)
   - Relatively strong intermolecular force
   - Responsible for water's unique properties
   - Examples: H₂O, NH₃, HF

4. **Ion-Dipole Interactions**
   - Occur between an ion and a polar molecule
   - Important in solutions of ionic compounds in polar solvents
   - Example: Na⁺ ions dissolved in water

**Relative Strength of Intermolecular Forces:**
Ion-Ion > Hydrogen Bonding > Dipole-Dipole > London Dispersion Forces

## Practice Problems

1. Draw the Lewis structure for CO₂ and predict its molecular geometry.
2. Determine the type of bonding in KBr and explain your reasoning.
3. Arrange the following in order of increasing boiling point: CH₄, H₂O, NH₃.
4. Predict whether each molecule is polar or nonpolar: CCl₄, NH₃, BF₃.
5. Draw the Lewis structure for PCl₅ and explain why it violates the octet rule.
