# Key Concepts and Definitions: Chemical Bonding

## Fundamental Concepts

- **Chemical Bond**: An attractive force that holds atoms together in compounds.

- **Octet Rule**: Atoms tend to gain, lose, or share electrons to achieve a full valence shell (usually 8 electrons), similar to the nearest noble gas configuration.

- **Valence Electrons**: Electrons in the outermost energy level of an atom that participate in bonding.

- **Electronegativity**: A measure of an atom's ability to attract shared electrons in a chemical bond.

## Types of Bonds

- **Ionic Bond**: A bond formed by the complete transfer of electrons from one atom to another, resulting in positively and negatively charged ions held together by electrostatic forces.

- **Covalent Bond**: A bond formed by the sharing of electron pairs between atoms.
  - **Nonpolar Covalent Bond**: Equal sharing of electron pairs between atoms with similar electronegativities.
  - **Polar Covalent Bond**: Unequal sharing of electron pairs due to differences in electronegativity.
  - **Coordinate Covalent Bond**: A bond where both shared electrons come from one atom.

- **Metallic Bond**: A bond formed in metals where valence electrons are delocalized and shared among a lattice of positive metal ions.

## Lewis Structures

- **Lewis Dot Symbol**: A notation showing the valence electrons of an atom as dots around the element's symbol.

- **Lewis Structure**: A diagram showing the bonding between atoms and the arrangement of valence electrons.

- **Bonding Pair**: A pair of electrons shared between two atoms.

- **Lone Pair**: A pair of valence electrons not shared in a bond.

- **Formal Charge**: The charge assigned to an atom in a molecule assuming that electrons in a bond are shared equally.

## Molecular Geometry

- **VSEPR Theory**: Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion theory predicts the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in molecules.

- **Electron-Pair Geometry**: The arrangement of electron pairs (both bonding and lone pairs) around a central atom.

- **Molecular Geometry**: The arrangement of atoms (not electron pairs) around a central atom.

- **Bond Angle**: The angle formed between two adjacent bonds to the same atom.

## Common Molecular Shapes

- **Linear**: Two electron groups, 180° bond angle (e.g., CO₂, BeF₂)

- **Trigonal Planar**: Three electron groups, 120° bond angles (e.g., BF₃, CO₃²⁻)

- **Tetrahedral**: Four electron groups, 109.5° bond angles (e.g., CH₄, NH₄⁺)

- **Trigonal Bipyramidal**: Five electron groups (e.g., PCl₅, SF₄)

- **Octahedral**: Six electron groups (e.g., SF₆, PCl₆⁻)

## Bond Properties

- **Bond Length**: The average distance between the nuclei of two bonded atoms.

- **Bond Energy**: The energy required to break a chemical bond.

- **Bond Order**: The number of electron pairs shared between two bonded atoms.

- **Dipole Moment**: A measure of the polarity of a bond, calculated as the product of charge separation and distance.

## Intermolecular Forces

- **London Dispersion Forces**: Weak attractions between temporary dipoles in all molecules.

- **Dipole-Dipole Interactions**: Attractions between permanent dipoles in polar molecules.

- **Hydrogen Bonding**: Strong dipole-dipole attraction when hydrogen is bonded to highly electronegative atoms (N, O, F).

- **Ion-Dipole Interactions**: Attractions between ions and polar molecules.

## Hybridization

- **sp Hybridization**: Mixing of one s and one p orbital, resulting in linear geometry.

- **sp² Hybridization**: Mixing of one s and two p orbitals, resulting in trigonal planar geometry.

- **sp³ Hybridization**: Mixing of one s and three p orbitals, resulting in tetrahedral geometry.

- **sp³d Hybridization**: Mixing of one s, three p, and one d orbital, resulting in trigonal bipyramidal geometry.

- **sp³d² Hybridization**: Mixing of one s, three p, and two d orbitals, resulting in octahedral geometry.
