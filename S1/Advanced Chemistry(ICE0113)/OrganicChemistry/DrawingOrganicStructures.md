## Introduction

Drawing organic structures accurately is a fundamental skill in organic chemistry. This guide will walk you through the various methods and conventions for representing organic molecules on paper, from simple Lewis structures to complex skeletal formulas and 3D representations.

## Basic Drawing Conventions

### Atoms and Bonds

1. **Single bonds**: Represented by a straight line (−)
2. **Double bonds**: Represented by two parallel lines (=)
3. **Triple bonds**: Represented by three parallel lines (≡)
4. **Carbon atoms**: Often implied at line junctions in skeletal structures
5. **Hydrogen atoms**: Often omitted when attached to carbon atoms in skeletal structures
6. **Heteroatoms**: Always explicitly shown (O, N, S, halogens, etc.)

### General Rules

- Every carbon atom forms 4 bonds
- Nitrogen forms 3 bonds
- Oxygen forms 2 bonds
- Halogens (F, Cl, Br, I) form 1 bond
- Hydrogen forms 1 bond

## Lewis Structures

Lewis structures show all atoms and bonds explicitly, including lone pairs of electrons.

### Steps to Draw Lewis Structures

1. **Count valence electrons**: Determine the total number of valence electrons in the molecule
2. **Arrange atoms**: Place the least electronegative atom in the center (usually carbon)
3. **Connect atoms**: Draw single bonds between atoms
4. **Assign remaining electrons**: Place remaining electrons as lone pairs
5. **Check octets**: Ensure all atoms have a full octet (except H, which needs 2 electrons)
6. **Form multiple bonds if needed**: Convert lone pairs to bonds if octets are not satisfied

### Example: Drawing Formaldehyde (CH₂O)

1. Count electrons: C (4) + O (6) + 2×H (2) = 12 electrons
2. Arrange atoms: C in center, O and H attached
3. Connect with single bonds: H−C−O−H (uses 6 electrons)
4. Distribute remaining electrons: Place 6 electrons as lone pairs on O
5. Check octets: C has only 6 electrons, needs 8
6. Form double bond: Convert one lone pair on O to a bond with C: H₂C=O

## Line-Angle Structures

Line-angle structures are a simplified representation where carbon atoms are implied at vertices and endpoints of lines.

### Steps to Draw Line-Angle Structures

1. **Draw carbon skeleton**: Represent carbon chain as a zigzag line
2. **Add functional groups**: Add heteroatoms and important groups explicitly
3. **Omit hydrogen atoms**: Hydrogen atoms on carbon are implied
4. **Show multiple bonds**: Draw double and triple bonds explicitly

### Example: Converting CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₂OH to Line-Angle

1. Draw the carbon skeleton as a zigzag line with 5 vertices
2. Add OH at the end
3. Result: A zigzag line with 4 segments and OH at one end

## Skeletal Structures

Skeletal structures (also called bond-line structures) are the most commonly used format in organic chemistry.

### Conventions in Skeletal Structures

- **Carbon atoms**: Not labeled, implied at vertices and endpoints
- **Hydrogen atoms on carbon**: Not shown, implied to fill carbon's valence
- **Heteroatoms**: Always shown explicitly
- **Hydrogen atoms on heteroatoms**: Shown explicitly (e.g., OH, NH₂)
- **Multiple bonds**: Shown as parallel lines

### Rules for Interpreting Skeletal Structures

1. Each vertex and endpoint represents a carbon atom unless labeled otherwise
2. Each carbon has enough hydrogen atoms to make four bonds total
3. Heteroatoms have their typical valence filled with hydrogen unless otherwise shown

### Example: Skeletal Structure of Ibuprofen

1. Draw the benzene ring as a hexagon
2. Add the isopropyl group as a branched line
3. Add the propionic acid side chain
4. Label the oxygen atoms in the carboxylic acid group

## Drawing Three-Dimensional Structures

Three-dimensional structures show the spatial arrangement of atoms.

### Common 3D Bond Representations

- **Solid line (−)**: Bond in the plane of the paper
- **Wedged line (▼)**: Bond coming out of the plane toward the viewer
- **Dashed line (- - -)**: Bond going behind the plane away from the viewer
- **Wavy line (~)**: Bond of undefined or variable orientation

### Steps to Draw 3D Structures

1. **Identify the central atom**: Usually the stereocenter
2. **Arrange substituents**: Position the four groups around the central carbon
3. **Assign bond types**: Use solid, wedged, and dashed lines to show 3D arrangement
4. **Check consistency**: Ensure the drawing represents the intended stereochemistry

### Example: Drawing a 3D Representation of 2-Butanol

1. Identify the stereocenter (carbon with OH attached)
2. Draw the carbon chain with appropriate bond angles
3. Use wedged line for OH group (coming forward)
4. Use dashed line for CH₃ group (going back)
5. Use solid lines for the remaining bonds (in the plane)

## Drawing Resonance Structures

Resonance structures show the delocalization of electrons in a molecule.

### Steps to Draw Resonance Structures

1. **Identify the resonance system**: Locate π bonds and adjacent p orbitals
2. **Draw the first structure**: Draw a valid Lewis structure
3. **Move electrons**: Move electron pairs using curved arrows
4. **Maintain charges and electron count**: Total charge and electron count must stay constant
5. **Draw the second structure**: Draw the resulting structure after electron movement

### Example: Drawing Resonance in Benzene

1. Draw benzene with alternating single and double bonds
2. Use curved arrows to show movement of electron pairs
3. Draw the alternative arrangement of single and double bonds
4. Use double-headed arrow (↔) between resonance forms

## Drawing Common Functional Groups

### Alcohols
- OH group attached to a carbon
- Example: CH₃CH₂OH can be drawn as a zigzag line with OH at the end

### Aldehydes
- C=O group at the end of a carbon chain
- Terminal carbon explicitly drawn with double-bonded O and a H
- Example: CH₃CH₂CHO shown as zigzag with CHO at end

### Ketones
- C=O group within a carbon chain
- Example: CH₃COCH₃ shown as O double-bonded to middle carbon

### Carboxylic Acids
- COOH group at the end of a carbon chain
- Example: CH₃COOH shown as zigzag with COOH at end

### Esters
- COO group connecting two carbon chains
- Example: CH₃COOCH₂CH₃ shown with C(=O)O connecting two carbon chains

### Amines
- Nitrogen atom with single bonds to carbons/hydrogens
- Example: CH₃NH₂ shown as zigzag with NH₂ at end

## Drawing Reaction Mechanisms

Reaction mechanisms use curved arrows to show electron movement.

### Types of Arrows

- **Full-headed curved arrow (→)**: Movement of an electron pair
- **Half-headed curved arrow (⇀)**: Movement of a single electron (radical reactions)
- **Double-headed straight arrow (↔)**: Resonance structures
- **Single-headed straight arrow (→)**: Reaction progression or product formation

### Steps for Drawing Mechanisms

1. **Draw starting materials**: Draw skeletal structures of reactants
2. **Identify electron-rich and electron-poor sites**: Identify nucleophiles and electrophiles
3. **Draw curved arrows**: Show electron movement from electron-rich to electron-poor sites
4. **Draw intermediates**: Show structures after each electron movement step
5. **Continue until product is formed**: Draw each step in the reaction sequence

### Example: Acid-Catalyzed Esterification Mechanism

1. Draw carboxylic acid and alcohol reactants
2. Show protonation of carbonyl oxygen
3. Show nucleophilic attack by alcohol
4. Show proton transfer steps
5. Show elimination of water
6. Show deprotonation to form final ester product
