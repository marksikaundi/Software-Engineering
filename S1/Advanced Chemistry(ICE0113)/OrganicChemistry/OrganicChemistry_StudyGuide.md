## Introduction to Organic Chemistry

Organic chemistry is the study of carbon-containing compounds, their properties, structure, composition, reactions, and preparation. While originally defined as the chemistry of substances derived from living organisms, organic chemistry now encompasses all carbon compounds with the exception of a few simple molecules like carbon dioxide (CO₂), carbonates, and cyanides.

**Key Points:**
- More than 95% of all known compounds are organic
- Carbon forms the backbone of all organic compounds
- Organic compounds are essential to life processes
- Applications span medicine, materials science, energy, and agriculture

## Carbon and Its Unique Properties

Carbon's position in Group 14 (4A) of the periodic table gives it unique properties that make it the foundation of organic chemistry.

**Key Properties:**
- Atomic number: 6
- Electronic configuration: 1s² 2s² 2p²
- Valence: 4 (forms 4 bonds)
- Catenation: Carbon can form stable bonds with other carbon atoms
- Ability to form single, double, and triple bonds
- Can form long chains, branched structures, and rings

**Hybridization States:**
- sp³: tetrahedral geometry (109.5° bond angles)
- sp²: trigonal planar geometry (120° bond angles)
- sp: linear geometry (180° bond angles)

## Hydrocarbons

Hydrocarbons are compounds composed only of carbon and hydrogen atoms.

### Alkanes

Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons with single bonds between carbon atoms.

**General formula:** CₙH₂ₙ₊₂

**Nomenclature Rules:**
1. Identify the longest continuous carbon chain
2. Number the carbon atoms to give substituents the lowest possible numbers
3. Name substituents and list them alphabetically with position numbers
4. Use prefixes (di-, tri-, tetra-, etc.) for multiple identical substituents

**First Ten Alkanes:**
| Name | Formula | Structure |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Methane | CH₄ | One carbon |
| Ethane | C₂H₆ | Two carbons in a chain |
| Propane | C₃H₈ | Three carbons in a chain |
| Butane | C₄H₁₀ | Four carbons in a chain |
| Pentane | C₅H₁₂ | Five carbons in a chain |
| Hexane | C₆H₁₄ | Six carbons in a chain |
| Heptane | C₇H₁₆ | Seven carbons in a chain |
| Octane | C₈H₁₈ | Eight carbons in a chain |
| Nonane | C₉H₂₀ | Nine carbons in a chain |
| Decane | C₁₀H₂₂ | Ten carbons in a chain |

**Properties of Alkanes:**
- Nonpolar
- Low reactivity (except combustion)
- Lower density than water
- Insoluble in water, soluble in nonpolar solvents
- Boiling and melting points increase with molecular weight

### Alkenes

Alkenes contain at least one carbon-carbon double bond.

**General formula:** CₙH₂ₙ

**Nomenclature:**
1. Identify the longest chain containing the double bond
2. Number the chain to give the double bond the lowest number
3. Use the ending "-ene" to indicate a double bond

**Examples:**
- Ethene (C₂H₄) - simplest alkene
- Propene (C₃H₆)
- 1-Butene (C₄H₈)

**Properties of Alkenes:**
- More reactive than alkanes
- Can undergo addition reactions
- Exhibit geometric (cis-trans) isomerism when substituents are on each carbon

### Alkynes

Alkynes contain at least one carbon-carbon triple bond.

**General formula:** CₙH₂ₙ₋₂

**Nomenclature:**
1. Similar to alkenes, but use the ending "-yne"
2. Number the chain to give the triple bond the lowest number

**Examples:**
- Ethyne (acetylene, C₂H₂) - simplest alkyne
- Propyne (C₃H₄)
- 1-Butyne (C₄H₆)

**Properties of Alkynes:**
- Even more reactive than alkenes
- Linear geometry around the triple bond
- Slightly acidic terminal hydrogen

### Aromatic Compounds

Aromatic compounds contain at least one benzene ring or similar structure.

**Benzene (C₆H₆):**
- Planar ring with delocalized electrons
- Unusual stability
- Undergoes substitution rather than addition reactions

**Nomenclature:**
1. Monosubstituted benzenes often named as derivatives (e.g., toluene, phenol)
2. Disubstituted benzenes use prefixes ortho- (1,2), meta- (1,3), para- (1,4)
3. For complex structures, benzene may be treated as a substituent (phenyl group)

## Functional Groups

Functional groups are specific atoms or groups of atoms that give organic compounds their characteristic chemical properties.

| Functional Group | Structure | Class of Compound | Example |
|------------------|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| Hydroxyl | -OH | Alcohol | Ethanol (C₂H₅OH) |
| Carbonyl | C=O | Aldehyde (at end of chain)<br>Ketone (within chain) | Acetaldehyde (CH₃CHO)<br>Acetone (CH₃COCH₃) |
| Carboxyl | -COOH | Carboxylic acid | Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) |
| Ether | -O- | Ether | Diethyl ether (C₂H₅OC₂H₅) |
| Ester | -COO- | Ester | Ethyl acetate (CH₃COOC₂H₅) |
| Amine | -NH₂ | Amine | Methylamine (CH₃NH₂) |
| Amide | -CONH₂ | Amide | Acetamide (CH₃CONH₂) |
| Halide | -X (F, Cl, Br, I) | Alkyl halide | Chloromethane (CH₃Cl) |

## Isomerism

Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structural arrangements.

### Structural Isomerism

**Types:**
1. **Chain isomerism**: Different carbon chain arrangements
   - Example: Butane (straight chain) vs. 2-methylpropane (branched)

2. **Position isomerism**: Same chain but functional groups in different positions
   - Example: 1-propanol vs. 2-propanol

3. **Functional group isomerism**: Different functional groups
   - Example: Ethanol (C₂H₆O) vs. dimethyl ether (C₂H₆O)

### Stereoisomerism

Stereoisomers have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements.

1. **Geometric (cis-trans) isomerism**: Different arrangements around a double bond
   - Example: cis-2-butene vs. trans-2-butene

2. **Optical isomerism**: Mirror images that cannot be superimposed
   - Example: Lactic acid has a chiral carbon with four different groups attached

## Organic Reactions

### Common Reaction Types

1. **Addition reactions**: Typical of alkenes and alkynes
   - Example: Hydrogenation (H₂ added across double bond)
   - Example: Halogenation (X₂ added across double bond)

2. **Elimination reactions**: Formation of multiple bonds by removing atoms
   - Example: Dehydration of alcohols to form alkenes

3. **Substitution reactions**: One atom/group replaces another
   - Example: Halogenation of alkanes
   - SN1 and SN2 reactions

4. **Oxidation-Reduction reactions**:
   - Oxidation: Gain of oxygen or loss of hydrogen
   - Reduction: Loss of oxygen or gain of hydrogen
   - Example: Alcohol oxidation to aldehyde or ketone

5. **Acid-Base reactions**:
   - Example: Carboxylic acids with bases forming salts

## Summary

Organic chemistry is centered around carbon-containing compounds and their reactions. Key concepts include:

1. Carbon's ability to form four bonds and create diverse molecular structures
2. Classification of hydrocarbons: alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and aromatic compounds
3. Functional groups that determine chemical properties
4. Various types of isomerism
5. Common organic reaction mechanisms

Understanding these fundamentals provides the foundation for exploring more complex organic molecules and their applications in pharmaceuticals, materials science, and biochemistry.
