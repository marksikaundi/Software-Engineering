# Organic Chemistry Flashcards

## Basic Concepts

Q: What is organic chemistry?
A: The study of carbon-containing compounds, their structures, properties, and reactions.

Q: Why is carbon able to form so many compounds?
A: Carbon has 4 valence electrons, allowing it to form 4 bonds with various elements and other carbon atoms, creating chains, rings, and complex structures.

Q: What are hydrocarbons?
A: Compounds containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms.

Q: What is a functional group?
A: A specific group of atoms within a molecule that gives the compound its characteristic chemical properties and reactions.

## Alkanes

Q: What is the general formula for alkanes?
A: CₙH₂ₙ₊₂

Q: What type of bonds do alkanes contain?
A: Only single bonds (C-C and C-H)

Q: Name the first 5 alkanes.
A: Methane (CH₄), Ethane (C₂H₆), Propane (C₃H₈), Butane (C₄H₁₀), Pentane (C₅H₁₂)

Q: What is the hybridization state of carbon in alkanes?
A: sp³ hybridization with tetrahedral geometry (109.5° bond angles)

## Alkenes

Q: What is the general formula for alkenes?
A: CₙH₂ₙ

Q: What is the defining feature of alkenes?
A: They contain at least one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)

Q: What is the hybridization state of carbon atoms in a double bond?
A: sp² hybridization with trigonal planar geometry (120° bond angles)

Q: What type of isomerism can occur in alkenes?
A: Geometric (cis-trans) isomerism when different groups are attached to each carbon of the double bond

## Alkynes

Q: What is the general formula for alkynes?
A: CₙH₂ₙ₋₂

Q: What is the defining feature of alkynes?
A: They contain at least one carbon-carbon triple bond (C≡C)

Q: What is the hybridization state of carbon atoms in a triple bond?
A: sp hybridization with linear geometry (180° bond angles)

Q: Why are terminal alkynes slightly acidic?
A: The sp-hybridized carbon makes the C-H bond more polarized, allowing the hydrogen to be removed as H⁺

## Aromatic Compounds

Q: What is the simplest aromatic compound?
A: Benzene (C₆H₆)

Q: What structural feature gives aromatic compounds their stability?
A: A planar ring with delocalized π electrons (resonance)

Q: What type of reactions do aromatic compounds typically undergo?
A: Electrophilic aromatic substitution rather than addition reactions

Q: What are the prefixes used for disubstituted benzenes?
A: ortho- (1,2-positions), meta- (1,3-positions), para- (1,4-positions)

## Functional Groups

Q: What functional group is present in alcohols?
A: Hydroxyl group (-OH)

Q: What functional group is present in aldehydes?
A: Carbonyl group (-CHO) at the end of a carbon chain

Q: What functional group is present in ketones?
A: Carbonyl group (C=O) within a carbon chain

Q: What functional group is present in carboxylic acids?
A: Carboxyl group (-COOH)

Q: What functional group is present in esters?
A: -COO- group (formed from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol)

Q: What functional group is present in amines?
A: -NH₂, -NHR, or -NR₂ (where R is an alkyl group)

Q: What functional group is present in ethers?
A: -O- (oxygen atom bonded to two carbon atoms)

## Isomerism

Q: What are isomers?
A: Compounds with the same molecular formula but different structural arrangements

Q: What is the difference between structural isomers and stereoisomers?
A: Structural isomers have different connectivity of atoms, while stereoisomers have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements

Q: What is a chiral center?
A: A carbon atom bonded to four different groups, creating a center of asymmetry

Q: What are enantiomers?
A: Stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other

## Organic Reactions

Q: What happens in an addition reaction?
A: Atoms or groups are added to a double or triple bond, breaking the multiple bond

Q: What happens in an elimination reaction?
A: Atoms or groups are removed from adjacent carbon atoms, forming a multiple bond

Q: What happens in a substitution reaction?
A: One atom or group replaces another atom or group in a molecule

Q: What is the difference between SN1 and SN2 reactions?
A: SN1 is a two-step process with a carbocation intermediate, while SN2 is a one-step process with backside attack and inversion of configuration

Q: What is the difference between oxidation and reduction in organic chemistry?
A: Oxidation involves gain of oxygen or loss of hydrogen; reduction involves loss of oxygen or gain of hydrogen
