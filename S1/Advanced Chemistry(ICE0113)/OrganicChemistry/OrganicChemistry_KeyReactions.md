# Key Reactions in Organic Chemistry

## Alkane Reactions

### 1. Combustion
CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O + energy
- Complete combustion produces carbon dioxide and water
- Incomplete combustion produces carbon monoxide

### 2. Halogenation
CH₄ + Cl₂ → CH₃Cl + HCl
- Requires UV light or heat (free radical mechanism)
- Can lead to multiple substitutions
- Reactivity: F₂ > Cl₂ > Br₂ > I₂

## Alkene Reactions

### 1. Hydrogenation
CH₂=CH₂ + H₂ → CH₃-CH₃
- Requires metal catalyst (Pt, Pd, or Ni)
- Syn addition (both H atoms add to same face)

### 2. Halogenation
CH₂=CH₂ + Br₂ → BrCH₂-CH₂Br
- Forms vicinal dihalides
- Anti addition (halogens add from opposite faces)
- Bromine test: Bromine water decolorizes with alkenes

### 3. Hydrohalogenation
CH₂=CH₂ + HBr → CH₃-CH₂Br
- Follows Markovnikov's rule (H⁺ adds to carbon with more H's)
- Exception: Anti-Markovnikov addition with HBr and peroxides (free radical)

### 4. Hydration
CH₂=CH₂ + H₂O → CH₃-CH₂OH
- Requires acid catalyst
- Follows Markovnikov's rule

### 5. Polymerization
n(CH₂=CH₂) → -(CH₂-CH₂)ₙ-
- Forms polymers like polyethylene

## Alkyne Reactions

### 1. Hydrogenation
HC≡CH + 2H₂ → CH₃-CH₃
- Can be controlled to stop at alkene stage with specific catalysts

### 2. Hydration
HC≡CH + H₂O → CH₃-CHO
- Requires Hg²⁺ catalyst and acid
- Follows Markovnikov's rule
- Forms ketones (internal alkynes) or aldehydes (terminal alkynes)

## Aromatic Reactions

### 1. Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution

#### a. Halogenation
C₆H₆ + Br₂ → C₆H₅Br + HBr
- Requires Lewis acid catalyst (FeBr₃, AlCl₃)

#### b. Nitration
C₆H₆ + HNO₃ → C₆H₅NO₂ + H₂O
- Requires H₂SO₄ catalyst

#### c. Sulfonation
C₆H₆ + H₂SO₄ → C₆H₅SO₃H + H₂O

#### d. Friedel-Crafts Alkylation
C₆H₆ + R-Cl → C₆H₅R + HCl
- Requires AlCl₃ catalyst
- Limited by carbocation rearrangements

#### e. Friedel-Crafts Acylation
C₆H₆ + R-COCl → C₆H₅COR + HCl
- Requires AlCl₃ catalyst

## Alcohol Reactions

### 1. Oxidation
RCH₂OH → RCHO → RCOOH
- Primary alcohols can be oxidized to aldehydes, then to carboxylic acids
- Secondary alcohols are oxidized to ketones
- Tertiary alcohols resist oxidation

### 2. Dehydration
CH₃CH₂OH → CH₂=CH₂ + H₂O
- Requires acid catalyst and heat
- Follows Zaitsev's rule (forms the most substituted alkene)

### 3. Esterification
R-COOH + R'-OH ⇌ R-COOR' + H₂O
- Requires acid catalyst
- Reversible reaction

## Aldehyde and Ketone Reactions

### 1. Reduction
RCHO + 2[H] → RCH₂OH
- Using NaBH₄ or LiAlH₄ as reducing agents

### 2. Oxidation
RCHO + [O] → RCOOH
- Aldehydes easily oxidized to carboxylic acids
- Ketones resist oxidation

### 3. Addition Reactions
#### a. Nucleophilic Addition
RCHO + HCN → RCH(OH)CN
- Forms cyanohydrins

#### b. Imine Formation
RCHO + RNH₂ → RCH=NR + H₂O
- Forms imines (Schiff bases)

## Carboxylic Acid Reactions

### 1. Esterification
R-COOH + R'-OH → R-COOR' + H₂O
- Requires acid catalyst

### 2. Reduction
R-COOH + 2[H] → RCH₂OH
- Requires strong reducing agent like LiAlH₄

### 3. Acid Chloride Formation
R-COOH + SOCl₂ → R-COCl + SO₂ + HCl
- Forms more reactive acid chlorides

## Important Mechanisms

### 1. SN1 (Substitution Nucleophilic Unimolecular)
- Two-step process
- Forms carbocation intermediate
- Rate depends only on substrate concentration
- Common in tertiary halides
- Can lead to racemization

### 2. SN2 (Substitution Nucleophilic Bimolecular)
- One-step process
- Backside attack by nucleophile
- Rate depends on both substrate and nucleophile concentrations
- Results in inversion of configuration
- Common in primary halides

### 3. E1 (Elimination Unimolecular)
- Two-step process with carbocation intermediate
- Competes with SN1
- Forms more substituted alkene (Zaitsev product)

### 4. E2 (Elimination Bimolecular)
- One-step process
- Requires antiperiplanar arrangement
- Competes with SN2
- Forms more substituted alkene usually
