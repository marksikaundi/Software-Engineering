# Chemical Nomenclature Study Materials

This directory contains comprehensive study materials for the topic of Chemical Nomenclature, based on David Goldberg's "Fundamentals of Chemistry" (pages 169-185).

## Study Resources

### 1. [Nomenclature Study Guide](Nomenclature_Study_Guide.md)
A comprehensive overview of chemical nomenclature covering both inorganic and organic compounds. This detailed guide explains the principles and rules of naming various types of chemical compounds with numerous examples.

### 2. [Nomenclature Quick Reference](Nomenclature_Quick_Reference.md)
A condensed reference card with the most important nomenclature rules and conventions. Perfect for quick review before exams or while solving problems.

### 3. [Nomenclature Practice Problems](Nomenclature_Practice_Problems.md)
A set of practice problems organized by increasing difficulty, covering both inorganic and organic nomenclature. Includes an answer key for self-assessment.

### 4. [Nomenclature Concept Map](Nomenclature_Concept_Map.md)
Visual representations of the relationships between different nomenclature systems and rules. Note that you'll need a Markdown viewer that supports Mermaid diagrams to view these properly.

## How to Use These Materials

1. **For learning the basics**: Start with the Study Guide for a thorough introduction to nomenclature principles
2. **For quick review**: Use the Quick Reference to refresh your memory on key rules
3. **For practice**: Test your knowledge with the Practice Problems
4. **For conceptual understanding**: Review the Concept Map to see how different naming systems relate to each other

## Topics Covered

- Binary and ternary inorganic compounds
- Acids and bases
- Hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, alkynes)
- Organic compounds with functional groups
- IUPAC nomenclature rules
- Common and systematic naming conventions

## Additional Resources

For more in-depth study, consider:
- The IUPAC Red Book (Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry)
- The IUPAC Blue Book (Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry)
- The IUPAC Gold Book (Compendium of Chemical Terminology)

## Note on Diagrams

The concept maps in the Nomenclature Concept Map file use Mermaid diagram syntax. To view them properly, use a Markdown viewer that supports Mermaid, such as:
- GitHub (in repositories)
- VSCode with the Markdown Preview Mermaid Support extension
- Various online Markdown editors with Mermaid support

If you cannot view the diagrams, consider copying the Mermaid code into an online Mermaid editor such as https://mermaid.live
