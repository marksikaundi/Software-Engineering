# Solutions - Solved Examples

## Concentration Units

### Example 1: Mass Percentage
**Problem**: A saline solution is prepared by dissolving 15.0 g of NaCl in 185.0 g of water. Calculate the mass percentage of NaCl in the solution.

**Solution**:
Mass of solution = Mass of solute + Mass of solvent
Mass of solution = 15.0 g + 185.0 g = 200.0 g

Mass percentage = (Mass of solute / Mass of solution) × 100%
Mass percentage = (15.0 g / 200.0 g) × 100% = 7.5%

### Example 2: Molarity
**Problem**: Calculate the molarity of a solution containing 23.4 g of sodium sulfate (Na₂SO₄, MW = 142.0 g/mol) dissolved in enough water to make 125 mL of solution.

**Solution**:
Moles of Na₂SO₄ = 23.4 g ÷ 142.0 g/mol = 0.1648 mol
Volume of solution = 125 mL = 0.125 L

Molarity = Moles of solute / Volume of solution in liters
Molarity = 0.1648 mol / 0.125 L = 1.32 M

### Example 3: Molality
**Problem**: What is the molality of a solution containing 5.85 g of NaCl (MW = 58.5 g/mol) dissolved in 0.250 kg of water?

**Solution**:
Moles of NaCl = 5.85 g ÷ 58.5 g/mol = 0.1000 mol
Mass of solvent = 0.250 kg

Molality = Moles of solute / Kilograms of solvent
Molality = 0.1000 mol / 0.250 kg = 0.400 m

### Example 4: Mole Fraction
**Problem**: A solution is prepared by mixing 50.0 g of ethanol (C₂H₅OH, MW = 46.0 g/mol) with 50.0 g of water (H₂O, MW = 18.0 g/mol). Calculate the mole fraction of ethanol in this solution.

**Solution**:
Moles of ethanol = 50.0 g ÷ 46.0 g/mol = 1.087 mol
Moles of water = 50.0 g ÷ 18.0 g/mol = 2.778 mol
Total moles = 1.087 mol + 2.778 mol = 3.865 mol

Mole fraction of ethanol = Moles of ethanol / Total moles
Mole fraction of ethanol = 1.087 mol / 3.865 mol = 0.281

## Henry's Law

### Example 5: Gas Solubility
**Problem**: The Henry's law constant for CO₂ in water at 25°C is 3.4 × 10⁻² mol/L·atm. Calculate the concentration of CO₂ in a soft drink that is bottled under a CO₂ pressure of 4.0 atm.

**Solution**:
Using Henry's Law: C = kP
C = (3.4 × 10⁻² mol/L·atm) × (4.0 atm) = 0.136 mol/L = 0.136 M

## Colligative Properties

### Example 6: Boiling Point Elevation
**Problem**: Calculate the boiling point of a solution containing 15.0 g of glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆, MW = 180.0 g/mol) dissolved in 250.0 g of water. (Kb for water = 0.52°C/m, normal boiling point of water = 100.0°C)

**Solution**:
Moles of glucose = 15.0 g ÷ 180.0 g/mol = 0.0833 mol
Kilograms of water = 250.0 g ÷ 1000 g/kg = 0.2500 kg

Molality = 0.0833 mol / 0.2500 kg = 0.333 m
ΔTb = Kb × m × i
where i = 1 (glucose is a nonelectrolyte)
ΔTb = 0.52°C/m × 0.333 m × 1 = 0.173°C

Boiling point = 100.0°C + 0.173°C = 100.2°C

### Example 7: Freezing Point Depression
**Problem**: What mass of CaCl₂ (MW = 111.0 g/mol) should be added to 750 g of water to create a solution with a freezing point of -2.5°C? (Kf for water = 1.86°C/m, normal freezing point of water = 0.0°C)

**Solution**:
ΔTf = 0.0°C - (-2.5°C) = 2.5°C
ΔTf = Kf × m × i
where i = 3 for CaCl₂ (it dissociates into 3 ions: Ca²⁺ + 2Cl⁻)

2.5°C = 1.86°C/m × m × 3
m = 2.5°C ÷ (1.86°C/m × 3) = 0.448 m

Moles of CaCl₂ = m × kg of solvent = 0.448 mol/kg × 0.750 kg = 0.336 mol
Mass of CaCl₂ = 0.336 mol × 111.0 g/mol = 37.3 g

### Example 8: Osmotic Pressure
**Problem**: Calculate the osmotic pressure of a 0.10 M glucose solution at 25°C.

**Solution**:
π = MRT
where M = molarity (0.10 mol/L)
R = gas constant (0.08206 L·atm/mol·K)
T = temperature in Kelvin = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K

π = 0.10 mol/L × 0.08206 L·atm/mol·K × 298.15 K = 2.45 atm

## Solution Stoichiometry

### Example 9: Dilution
**Problem**: How would you prepare 500.0 mL of 0.100 M HCl from a 12.0 M HCl stock solution?

**Solution**:
Using the dilution equation: M₁V₁ = M₂V₂
(12.0 M) × V₁ = (0.100 M) × (500.0 mL)
V₁ = (0.100 M × 500.0 mL) ÷ 12.0 M = 4.17 mL

To prepare the solution: Add 4.17 mL of 12.0 M HCl to enough water to make 500.0 mL of solution.

### Example 10: Titration
**Problem**: If 25.0 mL of a 0.10 M HCl solution is titrated with 0.15 M NaOH, what volume of NaOH is required to reach the equivalence point?

**Solution**:
Reaction: HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H₂O

Using the equation: (Molarity of A)(Volume of A)(a) = (Molarity of B)(Volume of B)(b)
where a and b are stoichiometric coefficients (both 1 in this case)

(0.10 M)(25.0 mL)(1) = (0.15 M)(VNaOH)(1)
VNaOH = (0.10 M × 25.0 mL) ÷ 0.15 M = 16.7 mL
