## Introduction to Solutions

A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances. The major component is called the **solvent**, and the minor component is called the **solute**.

### Key Characteristics of Solutions:
- **Homogeneous**: Uniform composition throughout
- **Stable**: Do not separate on standing
- **Particles are molecular or ionic in size** (< 1 nm)
- **Transparent**: Most solutions do not scatter light

## Types of Solutions

Solutions exist in all three physical states:

| State of Solution | Solute | Solvent | Examples |
|-------------------|--------|---------|----------|
| Gas | Gas | Gas | Air (oxygen in nitrogen) |
| Liquid | Gas | Liquid | Carbonated water (CO₂ in water) |
| Liquid | Liquid | Liquid | Vinegar (acetic acid in water) |
| Liquid | Solid | Liquid | Saltwater (NaCl in water) |
| Solid | Gas | Solid | Hydrogen in palladium |
| Solid | Liquid | Solid | Dental amalgams (mercury in silver) |
| Solid | Solid | Solid | Alloys (brass: zinc in copper) |

### Terminology:
- **Aqueous solution**: Water is the solvent
- **Dilute solution**: Small amount of solute
- **Concentrated solution**: Large amount of solute
- **Saturated solution**: Contains maximum amount of dissolved solute at equilibrium
- **Unsaturated solution**: Can dissolve more solute
- **Supersaturated solution**: Contains more solute than a saturated solution under the same conditions (metastable)

## Concentration Units

### Mass Percentage
- Mass % = (mass of solute / mass of solution) × 100%

### Parts Per Million (ppm) and Parts Per Billion (ppb)
- ppm = (mass of solute / mass of solution) × 10⁶
- ppb = (mass of solute / mass of solution) × 10⁹

### Mole Fraction (X)
- X₁ = moles of component 1 / total moles of all components
- Sum of all mole fractions = 1

### Molarity (M)
- M = moles of solute / liters of solution
- Most commonly used concentration unit in chemistry

### Molality (m)
- m = moles of solute / kilograms of solvent
- Advantage: Not affected by temperature changes

### Normality (N)
- N = number of equivalents of solute / liter of solution
- Equivalents depend on the reaction being considered

## The Solution Process

### Steps in Dissolution:
1. **Solute separation**: Breaking intermolecular forces in the solute
2. **Solvent separation**: Breaking intermolecular forces in the solvent
3. **Solute-solvent interaction**: Formation of new intermolecular forces

### Energetics of Solution Formation:
- ΔH₍solution₎ = ΔH₍solute separation₎ + ΔH₍solvent separation₎ + ΔH₍mixing₎
- Solutions form when the overall process is energetically favorable

### General Rule for Solubility:
- **"Like dissolves like"**
  - Polar solutes dissolve in polar solvents
  - Nonpolar solutes dissolve in nonpolar solvents

## Factors Affecting Solubility

### Temperature Effects:
- **For solid solutes in liquid solvents**:
  - Solubility usually increases with temperature
  - Exceptions exist (e.g., Ce₂(SO₄)₃ in water)
- **For gases in liquid solvents**:
  - Solubility decreases with increasing temperature

### Pressure Effects:
- **For solid and liquid solutes**:
  - Minimal effect
- **For gaseous solutes**:
  - Solubility is directly proportional to pressure
  - **Henry's Law**: C = kP
    - C is the concentration of gas
    - P is the partial pressure of gas
    - k is Henry's constant (specific to gas-solvent pair)

### Effect of Molecular Structure:
- **Ionic compounds**:
  - Generally soluble in polar solvents
  - General solubility rules for common ionic compounds:
    1. Most nitrates, acetates, and alkali metal salts are soluble
    2. Most chlorides are soluble (except AgCl, PbCl₂, HgCl₂)
    3. Most sulfates are soluble (except BaSO₄, PbSO₄, CaSO₄)
    4. Most hydroxides and carbonates are insoluble

## Colligative Properties

Colligative properties depend on the number of solute particles, not their identity.

### Vapor Pressure Lowering:
- **Raoult's Law**: P₁ = X₁P°₁
  - P₁ is the partial pressure of component 1
  - X₁ is the mole fraction of component 1
  - P°₁ is the vapor pressure of pure component 1
- Vapor pressure lowering: ΔP = P° - P = P°X₂ (where X₂ is solute mole fraction)

### Boiling Point Elevation:
- ΔTb = Kb × m × i
  - ΔTb is the boiling point elevation
  - Kb is the ebullioscopic constant (specific to the solvent)
  - m is the molality
  - i is the van't Hoff factor (number of ions per formula unit)

### Freezing Point Depression:
- ΔTf = Kf × m × i
  - ΔTf is the freezing point depression
  - Kf is the cryoscopic constant (specific to the solvent)
  - m is the molality
  - i is the van't Hoff factor

### Osmotic Pressure:
- π = MRT
  - π is the osmotic pressure
  - M is molarity of the solution
  - R is the gas constant
  - T is temperature in Kelvin

## Solution Stoichiometry

### Dilution Calculations:
- M₁V₁ = M₂V₂
  - M₁ is the initial molarity
  - V₁ is the initial volume
  - M₂ is the final molarity
  - V₂ is the final volume

### Titration Calculations:
- For a reaction: aA + bB → products
- (Molarity of A)(Volume of A)(a) = (Molarity of B)(Volume of B)(b)

## Colloids and Suspensions

### Comparison of Solutions, Colloids, and Suspensions:

| Property | Solution | Colloid | Suspension |
|----------|----------|---------|------------|
| Particle Size | < 1 nm | 1-1000 nm | > 1000 nm |
| Appearance | Transparent | Translucent | Opaque |
| Settles on Standing | No | No | Yes |
| Filterability | No | Some | Yes |
| Tyndall Effect | No | Yes | Yes |

### Types of Colloids:
- **Aerosol**: Liquid or solid dispersed in gas (e.g., fog, smoke)
- **Foam**: Gas dispersed in liquid or solid (e.g., whipped cream)
- **Emulsion**: Liquid dispersed in liquid (e.g., milk)
- **Sol**: Solid dispersed in liquid (e.g., blood)
- **Gel**: Liquid dispersed in solid (e.g., gelatin)

### Colloidal Properties:
- **Tyndall Effect**: Scattering of light by colloidal particles
- **Brownian Motion**: Random movement of colloidal particles
- **Adsorption**: Accumulation of molecules on the surface of colloidal particles
- **Coagulation**: Destabilization and aggregation of colloidal particles
