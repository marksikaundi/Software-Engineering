11. Solute is the substance present in lesser amount that dissolves in the solvent. Solvent is the substance present in greater amount in which the solute dissolves.

12. The solubility of most solid solutes in liquid solvents increases with temperature because the dissolution process is typically endothermic. Higher temperatures provide more thermal energy to overcome the intermolecular forces holding the solute particles together.

13. Raoult's Law states that the partial vapor pressure of a component in a solution equals its mole fraction multiplied by its pure vapor pressure (P₁ = X₁P°₁). This explains why adding a nonvolatile solute lowers the vapor pressure of a solvent.

14. Solutions have particles < 1 nm, are transparent, stable, and don't scatter light. Colloids have particles 1-1000 nm, are translucent, stable, and exhibit the Tyndall effect. Suspensions have particles > 1000 nm, are opaque, settle over time, and scatter light.

15. NaCl is a polar ionic compound. Water is a polar solvent, so it can solvate the ions through ion-dipole interactions. Hexane is nonpolar and cannot effectively solvate ions, following the "like dissolves like" principle.

16. Moles of KMnO₄ = 4.90 g ÷ 158.0 g/mol = 0.0310 mol
    Volume = 250.0 mL = 0.2500 L
    Molarity = 0.0310 mol ÷ 0.2500 L = 0.124 M

17. a) Mass percentage = (18.0 g ÷ 218.0 g) × 100% = 8.26%
    b) Molality = (18.0 g ÷ 180.0 g/mol) ÷ (200.0 g ÷ 1000 g/kg) = 0.500 m
    c) Moles of glucose = 18.0 g ÷ 180.0 g/mol = 0.100 mol
       Moles of water = 200.0 g ÷ 18.0 g/mol = 11.11 mol
       Mole fraction = 0.100 mol ÷ (0.100 mol + 11.11 mol) = 0.00892

18. ΔTf = Kf × m × i
    3.72°C = 1.86°C/m × 2.00 m × i
    i = 1.00 (nonelectrolyte)
    Calculated value matches the given value, so the molar mass is correct.

19. For Ba(OH)₂: moles = 0.200 M × 0.0450 L = 0.00900 mol
    Each Ba(OH)₂ provides 2 OH⁻ ions, so moles of OH⁻ = 0.0180 mol

    For HCl: moles = 0.250 M × 0.0950 L = 0.02375 mol
    Each HCl provides 1 H⁺ ion, so moles of H⁺ = 0.02375 mol

    Net: 0.02375 mol H⁺ - 0.0180 mol OH⁻ = 0.00575 mol excess H⁺
    Solution is acidic.

20. π = MRT
    18.6 torr × (1 atm ÷ 760 torr) = M × 0.08206 L·atm/mol·K × 298 K
    M = 0.00100 mol/L

    Concentration = 12.5 g ÷ 0.1000 L = 125 g/L
    Molar mass = 125 g/L ÷ 0.00100 mol/L = 125,000 g/mol
