# Solutions - Quick Reference Summary

## Definition
A **solution** is a homogeneous mixture where one substance (the solute) is uniformly distributed within another substance (the solvent).

## Key Terminology
- **Solvent**: The major component of a solution
- **Solute**: The minor component(s) dissolved in the solvent
- **Aqueous solution**: Water is the solvent
- **Saturated**: Contains maximum possible solute at equilibrium
- **Unsaturated**: Can dissolve more solute
- **Supersaturated**: Contains more solute than equilibrium allows (metastable)

## Concentration Units
| Unit | Formula | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Mass % | (mass of solute / mass of solution) × 100% | Common in commercial products |
| ppm/ppb | (mass of solute / mass of solution) × 10^6 or 10^9 | For very dilute solutions |
| Mole Fraction (X) | moles of component / total moles | Sum of all mole fractions = 1 |
| Molarity (M) | moles of solute / liters of solution | Most common in chemistry |
| Molality (m) | moles of solute / kg of solvent | Not affected by temperature |

## Solution Process
1. **Solute separation**: ΔH > 0 (endothermic)
2. **Solvent separation**: ΔH > 0 (endothermic)
3. **Solute-solvent mixing**: ΔH < 0 (exothermic)
4. **Net energy change**: ΔH₍solution₎ = ΔH₍solute₎ + ΔH₍solvent₎ + ΔH₍mixing₎

## Factors Affecting Solubility
- **Like dissolves like**: Polar dissolves polar, nonpolar dissolves nonpolar
- **Temperature effects**:
  - Solids in liquids: Usually ↑ with temperature
  - Gases in liquids: ↓ with temperature
- **Pressure effects**:
  - Solids/liquids: Minimal effect
  - Gases: Directly proportional (Henry's Law: C = kP)

## Colligative Properties
Properties that depend on particle count, not identity:

1. **Vapor Pressure Lowering**
   - Raoult's Law: P₁ = X₁P°₁
   - ΔP = P°₁X₂ (X₂ = solute mole fraction)

2. **Boiling Point Elevation**
   - ΔTb = Kb × m × i
   - Kb = ebullioscopic constant
   - i = van't Hoff factor (ions per formula)

3. **Freezing Point Depression**
   - ΔTf = Kf × m × i
   - Kf = cryoscopic constant

4. **Osmotic Pressure**
   - π = MRT
   - M = molarity, R = gas constant, T = temperature (K)

## Key Equations to Remember
- **Dilution**: M₁V₁ = M₂V₂
- **Titration**: MA × VA × a = MB × VB × b (where a, b are stoichiometric coefficients)
- **Henry's Law**: C = kP
- **Raoult's Law**: P₁ = X₁P°₁

## Solution vs. Colloid vs. Suspension
| Property | Solution | Colloid | Suspension |
|----------|----------|---------|------------|
| Particle size | < 1 nm | 1-1000 nm | > 1000 nm |
| Appearance | Clear | Translucent | Opaque |
| Settling | No | No | Yes |
| Tyndall effect | No | Yes | Yes |
