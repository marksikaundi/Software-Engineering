# Practice Problems with Solutions

## Section 1: Wave Properties and Quantum Mechanics

### Problem 1.1
Calculate the wavelength (in nm) of a photon with a frequency of 6.0 × 10¹⁴ Hz.

**Solution:**
Using the equation c = λν, where c is the speed of light (3.0 × 10⁸ m/s), λ is wavelength, and ν is frequency:

λ = c/ν = (3.0 × 10⁸ m/s) / (6.0 × 10¹⁴ Hz)
λ = 5.0 × 10⁻⁷ m = 500 nm

This corresponds to green light in the visible spectrum.

### Problem 1.2
Calculate the energy (in joules and electron volts) of a photon with a wavelength of 450 nm (blue light).

**Solution:**
Using E = hν = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s):

E = (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)(3.0 × 10⁸ m/s) / (450 × 10⁻⁹ m)
E = 4.42 × 10⁻¹⁹ J

Converting to electron volts (1 eV = 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ J):
E = (4.42 × 10⁻¹⁹ J) / (1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ J/eV) = 2.76 eV

### Problem 1.3
Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of an electron moving at 5.0 × 10⁶ m/s. The mass of an electron is 9.11 × 10⁻³¹ kg.

**Solution:**
Using the de Broglie equation λ = h/mv, where h is Planck's constant:

λ = (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / [(9.11 × 10⁻³¹ kg)(5.0 × 10⁶ m/s)]
λ = 1.45 × 10⁻¹⁰ m = 0.145 nm

This is comparable to the size of atoms, illustrating why the wave nature of electrons is important in atomic physics.

## Section 2: Quantum Numbers and Atomic Orbitals

### Problem 2.1
Determine all possible sets of quantum numbers (n, l, ml, ms) for electrons in the 3p subshell.

**Solution:**
For the 3p subshell:
- Principal quantum number n = 3
- Angular momentum quantum number l = 1 (for p subshell)
- Magnetic quantum number ml = -1, 0, +1
- Spin quantum number ms = +½ or -½

The possible combinations are:
1. (3, 1, -1, +½)
2. (3, 1, -1, -½)
3. (3, 1, 0, +½)
4. (3, 1, 0, -½)
5. (3, 1, +1, +½)
6. (3, 1, +1, -½)

These represent the six possible states for electrons in the 3p subshell.

### Problem 2.2
How many orbitals are in the n = 4 energy level? How many electrons can it hold?

**Solution:**
For n = 4, the possible values of l are 0, 1, 2, and 3 (s, p, d, and f subshells).

Number of orbitals:
- l = 0 (s subshell): 1 orbital
- l = 1 (p subshell): 3 orbitals
- l = 2 (d subshell): 5 orbitals
- l = 3 (f subshell): 7 orbitals

Total number of orbitals = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16 orbitals

Each orbital can hold 2 electrons, so the n = 4 energy level can hold a maximum of 16 × 2 = 32 electrons.

### Problem 2.3
Identify which of the following sets of quantum numbers are not allowed and explain why:
a) (2, 0, 0, +½)
b) (3, 3, 0, -½)
c) (4, 2, -3, +½)
d) (3, 2, 1, 0)

**Solution:**
a) (2, 0, 0, +½) - This set is allowed. n = 2, l = 0 (valid since l can be 0 to n-1), ml = 0 (valid since ml can range from -l to +l), ms = +½ (valid value for spin).

b) (3, 3, 0, -½) - Not allowed. For n = 3, the maximum value of l is n-1 = 2, but here l = 3.

c) (4, 2, -3, +½) - Not allowed. For l = 2, ml can only range from -2 to +2, but here ml = -3.

d) (3, 2, 1, 0) - Not allowed. The spin quantum number ms can only be +½ or -½, not 0.

## Section 3: Electron Configuration

### Problem 3.1
Write the complete electron configuration and orbital diagram for phosphorus (Z = 15).

**Solution:**
Complete electron configuration for phosphorus:
1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p³

Orbital diagram:
1s: [↑↓]
2s: [↑↓]
2p: [↑↓] [↑↓] [↑↓]
3s: [↑↓]
3p: [↑] [↑] [↑]

Note that the 3p electrons are all unpaired with parallel spins, following Hund's rule.

### Problem 3.2
Write the electron configuration of the following ions:
a) Fe²⁺ (Z = 26)
b) Br⁻ (Z = 35)
c) Ca²⁺ (Z = 20)

**Solution:**
a) Fe (Z = 26): 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶ 4s² 3d⁶
   Fe²⁺: 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶ 3d⁶ (loses the 4s electrons first)

b) Br (Z = 35): 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶ 4s² 3d¹⁰ 4p⁵
   Br⁻: 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶ 4s² 3d¹⁰ 4p⁶ (gains one electron to complete the 4p subshell)

c) Ca (Z = 20): 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶ 4s²
   Ca²⁺: 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶ (loses the two 4s electrons to achieve the argon configuration)

### Problem 3.3
Identify the element with the following electron configuration: [Ar] 4s² 3d¹⁰ 4p⁴. How many unpaired electrons does this element have in its ground state?

**Solution:**
[Ar] represents 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶
The full configuration is 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶ 4s² 3d¹⁰ 4p⁴

This corresponds to selenium (Se), element 34.

To determine the number of unpaired electrons, we need to look at the valence shell (4p⁴).
According to Hund's rule, the 4p electrons would be distributed as:
4p: [↑↓] [↑↓] [ ]

Therefore, selenium has 0 unpaired electrons in its ground state.

## Section 4: Electronic Structure and the Periodic Table

### Problem 4.1
Arrange the following elements in order of increasing atomic radius: P, Si, Na, Cl.

**Solution:**
Atomic radius generally decreases across a period and increases down a group.

Na (Z=11): [Ne] 3s¹
Si (Z=14): [Ne] 3s² 3p²
P (Z=15): [Ne] 3s² 3p³
Cl (Z=17): [Ne] 3s² 3p⁵

Cl and P are in the same period (period 3), with Cl further to the right, so Cl has a smaller radius than P.
P and Si are also in period 3, with P to the right of Si, so Si has a larger radius than P.
Na is in period 3 but is on the far left, so it has a larger radius than Si.

The order of increasing atomic radius is: Cl < P < Si < Na

### Problem 4.2
Arrange the following ions in order of increasing ionic radius: K⁺, Ca²⁺, S²⁻, Cl⁻.

**Solution:**
K⁺ (Z=19): [Ar] (lost one electron)
Ca²⁺ (Z=20): [Ar] (lost two electrons)
Cl⁻ (Z=17): [Ar] (gained one electron)
S²⁻ (Z=16): [Ar] (gained two electrons)

For ions with the same electronic configuration:
- Cations (positive ions) are smaller than the neutral atom due to increased effective nuclear charge
- Anions (negative ions) are larger than the neutral atom due to increased electron-electron repulsion
- For isoelectronic species (same electron configuration), the ion with the higher nuclear charge will have the smaller radius

All these ions have the same electron configuration [Ar], but different nuclear charges:
- K⁺: 19 protons
- Ca²⁺: 20 protons
- Cl⁻: 17 protons
- S²⁻: 16 protons

The order of increasing ionic radius is: Ca²⁺ < K⁺ < Cl⁻ < S²⁻

### Problem 4.3
Arrange the following elements in order of increasing first ionization energy: K, Ca, Ga, Ge.

**Solution:**
K (Z=19): [Ar] 4s¹
Ca (Z=20): [Ar] 4s²
Ga (Z=31): [Ar] 4s² 3d¹⁰ 4p¹
Ge (Z=32): [Ar] 4s² 3d¹⁰ 4p²

Ionization energy generally increases across a period and decreases down a group.

K and Ca are in period 4, with Ca to the right of K, so Ca generally has higher ionization energy.
However, Ca has a filled 4s subshell, which provides extra stability, making its ionization energy higher than might be expected.

Ga and Ge are also in period 4, with Ge to the right of Ga, so Ge has higher ionization energy.

K is at the beginning of period 4, so it has the lowest ionization energy among these elements.

The order of increasing first ionization energy is: K < Ga < Ca < Ge

## Section 5: Multi-electron Atoms

### Problem 5.1
Explain why the 4s orbital fills before the 3d orbital but empties before the 3d orbital when forming cations.

**Solution:**
The 4s orbital fills before the 3d orbital due to the aufbau principle and the relative energies of these orbitals in neutral atoms. The 4s orbital is slightly lower in energy than the 3d orbital due to penetration and shielding effects.

However, when forming cations, electrons are removed from the highest energy orbitals first. In a transition metal cation, once electrons are present in the 3d orbitals, the energy ordering changes: the 4s orbital becomes higher in energy than the 3d. This is due to:

1. The effective nuclear charge increases when electrons are removed
2. This affects the 4s electrons more than the 3d electrons
3. The energy of the 4s orbital increases relative to the 3d orbital

Therefore, when forming cations, electrons are removed from the 4s orbital first, then from the 3d orbital. This explains why transition metals like Fe²⁺ have the electron configuration [Ar] 3d⁶ rather than [Ar] 4s² 3d⁴.

### Problem 5.2
Why does chromium (Cr, Z=24) have the electron configuration [Ar] 4s¹ 3d⁵ instead of the expected [Ar] 4s² 3d⁴?

**Solution:**
The expected electron configuration for chromium (Cr, Z=24) based on the aufbau principle would be [Ar] 4s² 3d⁴. However, the actual configuration is [Ar] 4s¹ 3d⁵.

This exception occurs because:

1. Half-filled subshells (d⁵) have extra stability due to exchange energy
2. The energy difference between the 4s and 3d orbitals is very small
3. By promoting one electron from 4s to 3d, chromium achieves a more stable electronic structure with a half-filled d subshell
4. All five d orbitals now have one electron each, with parallel spins (following Hund's rule)
5. This configuration minimizes electron-electron repulsions

The extra stability gained from the half-filled d subshell more than compensates for the slight energy cost of promoting an electron from 4s to 3d.

### Problem 5.3
How many unpaired electrons are in each of the following atoms?
a) Mn (Z = 25)
b) Zn (Z = 30)
c) Br (Z = 35)

**Solution:**
a) Mn (Z = 25): [Ar] 4s² 3d⁵
   The 3d⁵ configuration has five electrons in five different d orbitals, all with parallel spins according to Hund's rule.
   Mn has 5 unpaired electrons.

b) Zn (Z = 30): [Ar] 4s² 3d¹⁰
   The 3d¹⁰ configuration represents a completely filled d subshell, with all electrons paired.
   Zn has 0 unpaired electrons.

c) Br (Z = 35): [Ar] 4s² 3d¹⁰ 4p⁵
   The 4p⁵ configuration would have three p orbitals with two electrons paired in two of them and one electron in the third:
   4p: [↑↓] [↑↓] [↑]
   Br has 1 unpaired electron.
