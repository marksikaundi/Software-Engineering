# Electronic Structure - Complete Study Guide

## Introduction
This study guide covers the essential concepts of Electronic Structure as outlined in Chemical Principles by Steven Zumdahl (pages 539-551) and Fundamentals of Chemistry by David Goldberg (pages 99-128). The guide is organized into logical sections to facilitate understanding of how electrons are arranged in atoms and how this arrangement affects the chemical properties of elements.
