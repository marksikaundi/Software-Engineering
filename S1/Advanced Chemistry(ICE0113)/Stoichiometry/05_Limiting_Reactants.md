# Limiting Reactants and Theoretical Yield

## Introduction to Limiting Reactants

In chemical reactions, reactants typically combine in specific mole ratios as determined by the balanced chemical equation. However, in real-world situations, reactants are not always provided in these exact ratios. When reactants are not present in the stoichiometric ratios, one reactant will be completely consumed before the others. This reactant limits the amount of product that can be formed and is called the **limiting reactant** (or limiting reagent).

The other reactants that are present in excess amounts are called **excess reactants**. After the reaction is complete, some of the excess reactants will remain unreacted.

## Identifying the Limiting Reactant

The limiting reactant can be identified by calculating the amount of product that could be formed from each reactant, assuming the other reactants are present in excess. The reactant that produces the least amount of product is the limiting reactant.

### Two-Step Method for Determining the Limiting Reactant:

1. Calculate the moles of each reactant provided
2. Determine how much product could be formed from each reactant
3. The reactant that produces the least amount of product is the limiting reactant

### Example 1:
Consider the reaction: 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O

If 4.0 moles of H₂ and 3.0 moles of O₂ are available, which is the limiting reactant?

Step 1: Calculate the amount of water that could be produced from the hydrogen.
- From the balanced equation, 2 mol H₂ produces 2 mol H₂O
- Therefore, 4.0 mol H₂ could produce:
  4.0 mol H₂ × (2 mol H₂O / 2 mol H₂) = 4.0 mol H₂O

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water that could be produced from the oxygen.
- From the balanced equation, 1 mol O₂ produces 2 mol H₂O
- Therefore, 3.0 mol O₂ could produce:
  3.0 mol O₂ × (2 mol H₂O / 1 mol O₂) = 6.0 mol H₂O

Step 3: Compare the amounts.
- H₂ would produce 4.0 mol H₂O
- O₂ would produce 6.0 mol H₂O
- Since hydrogen produces less product, hydrogen is the limiting reactant.

## Mole-to-Mole Method

Another approach to identifying the limiting reactant is to compare the mole ratios of the reactants present to the mole ratios required by the balanced equation.

### Example 2:
For the reaction: N₂ + 3H₂ → 2NH₃

If you have 2.0 moles of N₂ and 5.0 moles of H₂, determine the limiting reactant.

Step 1: Determine the mole ratio of the reactants in the balanced equation.
- N₂:H₂ = 1:3

Step 2: Calculate the mole ratio of the reactants provided.
- N₂:H₂ = 2.0:5.0 = 1:2.5

Step 3: Compare the ratios.
- Required ratio: N₂:H₂ = 1:3
- Actual ratio: N₂:H₂ = 1:2.5
- Since the actual ratio has less H₂ compared to N₂ than required, H₂ is the limiting reactant.

Alternatively:
- If all 2.0 mol N₂ reacts, it would need 2.0 × 3 = 6.0 mol H₂
- Only 5.0 mol H₂ is available, so H₂ is the limiting reactant.

## Calculations with Limiting Reactants

Once the limiting reactant is identified, all calculations for the amount of product formed must be based on the limiting reactant.

### Example 3:
For the reaction: 2Al + 3Cl₂ → 2AlCl₃

If 4.0 g of aluminum reacts with 12.0 g of chlorine, determine:
a) The limiting reactant
b) The mass of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃) formed
c) The mass of excess reactant remaining

Solution:

Step 1: Convert the given masses to moles.
- Molar mass of Al = 27.0 g/mol
- Moles of Al = 4.0 g ÷ 27.0 g/mol = 0.148 mol

- Molar mass of Cl₂ = 71.0 g/mol
- Moles of Cl₂ = 12.0 g ÷ 71.0 g/mol = 0.169 mol

Step 2: Calculate how much AlCl₃ each reactant could produce.
- From Al: 0.148 mol Al × (2 mol AlCl₃ / 2 mol Al) = 0.148 mol AlCl₃
- From Cl₂: 0.169 mol Cl₂ × (2 mol AlCl₃ / 3 mol Cl₂) = 0.113 mol AlCl₃

Step 3: Determine the limiting reactant.
- Al would produce 0.148 mol AlCl₃
- Cl₂ would produce 0.113 mol AlCl₃
- Since Cl₂ produces less product, it is the limiting reactant.

Step 4: Calculate the mass of AlCl₃ formed.
- Molar mass of AlCl₃ = 27.0 + 3(35.5) = 133.5 g/mol
- Mass of AlCl₃ = 0.113 mol × 133.5 g/mol = 15.1 g

Step 5: Calculate the amount of excess reactant (Al) that remains.
- Al required for 0.113 mol AlCl₃ = 0.113 mol AlCl₃ × (2 mol Al / 2 mol AlCl₃) = 0.113 mol Al
- Al remaining = 0.148 mol - 0.113 mol = 0.035 mol
- Mass of Al remaining = 0.035 mol × 27.0 g/mol = 0.95 g

## Theoretical Yield

The amount of product calculated to form when all of the limiting reactant reacts is called the **theoretical yield**. This is the maximum possible amount of product that could be formed in the reaction.

### Example 4:
In the reaction from Example 3, the theoretical yield of AlCl₃ is 15.1 g.

## Real-World Applications of Limiting Reactants

Understanding limiting reactants is crucial in various fields:

1. **Industrial Chemistry**:

   - Process optimization focuses on identifying and efficiently using limiting reactants

2. **Pharmaceutical Industry**:
   - Drug synthesis requires precise reactant quantities to maximize yield
   - Limiting reactant analysis helps determine optimal reaction conditions

3. **Environmental Chemistry**:

   - Understanding which reactants limit chemical reactions in natural systems

4. **Food Chemistry**:
   - Baking and cooking processes often involve limiting reactants
