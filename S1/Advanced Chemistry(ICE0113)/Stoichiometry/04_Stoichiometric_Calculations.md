# Stoichiometric Calculations

## Overview of Stoichiometric Problem-Solving

Stoichiometry allows chemists to calculate the amounts of reactants needed or products formed in chemical reactions. This powerful tool is fundamental to both laboratory research and industrial applications of chemistry.

Stoichiometric calculations follow a logical sequence of steps that convert between different units and quantities:

1. Start with the given information (usually mass, volume, or number of moles)
2. Convert to moles if not already in mole units
3. Use mole ratios from the balanced equation to determine moles of the desired substance
4. Convert moles to the requested final units (mass, volume, or number of particles)

## Mole-to-Mole Conversions

The simplest stoichiometric calculations involve converting from moles of one substance to moles of another using the coefficients in a balanced chemical equation.

### Key Concept: Mole Ratios

A **mole ratio** is the ratio of moles of one substance to moles of another substance in a balanced chemical equation. The mole ratio is determined by the coefficients in the balanced equation.

Example: For the reaction 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O:
- The mole ratio of H₂ to O₂ is 2:1
- The mole ratio of O₂ to H₂O is 1:2
- The mole ratio of H₂ to H₂O is 2:2 or 1:1

### Example Problem 1:
In the reaction 4NH₃ + 5O₂ → 4NO + 6H₂O, how many moles of oxygen (O₂) are needed to react completely with 3.0 moles of ammonia (NH₃)?

Solution:
1. Identify the mole ratio: NH₃:O₂ = 4:5
2. Set up the conversion: 3.0 mol NH₃ × (5 mol O₂ / 4 mol NH₃) = 3.75 mol O₂

## Mass-to-Mass Conversions

Most practical problems involve substances measured by mass (grams) rather than moles. Mass-to-mass conversions are the most common type of stoichiometric calculation.

### General Process for Mass-to-Mass Calculations:

Mass of A → Moles of A → Moles of B → Mass of B

Where A is the substance you start with and B is the substance you want to find.

### Example Problem 2:
How many grams of carbon dioxide (CO₂) will be produced when 25.0 g of propane (C₃H₈) burns completely in oxygen?

The balanced equation is: C₃H₈ + 5O₂ → 3CO₂ + 4H₂O

Solution:

Step 1: Calculate the molar mass of propane (C₃H₈)
- C: 3 × 12.01 g/mol = 36.03 g/mol
- H: 8 × 1.008 g/mol = 8.064 g/mol
- Molar mass of C₃H₈ = 36.03 + 8.064 = 44.09 g/mol

Step 2: Convert the mass of propane to moles
- Moles of C₃H₈ = 25.0 g ÷ 44.09 g/mol = 0.567 mol

Step 3: Use the mole ratio from the balanced equation to find moles of CO₂
- The ratio of C₃H₈:CO₂ = 1:3
- Moles of CO₂ = 0.567 mol C₃H₈ × (3 mol CO₂ / 1 mol C₃H₈) = 1.70 mol CO₂

Step 4: Calculate the molar mass of carbon dioxide (CO₂)
- C: 1 × 12.01 g/mol = 12.01 g/mol
- O: 2 × 16.00 g/mol = 32.00 g/mol
- Molar mass of CO₂ = 44.01 g/mol

Step 5: Convert moles of CO₂ to mass
- Mass of CO₂ = 1.70 mol × 44.01 g/mol = 74.8 g

Therefore, 25.0 g of propane will produce 74.8 g of carbon dioxide.

## Mass-to-Volume and Volume-to-Mass Conversions

For gases, we often need to convert between mass and volume. These calculations use the molar volume of gases.

### Key Concept: Molar Volume of Gases
At standard temperature and pressure (STP: 0°C and 1 atm), one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.

### Example Problem 3:
What volume of oxygen gas at STP is required to completely react with 10.0 g of aluminum according to the equation: 4Al + 3O₂ → 2Al₂O₃?

Solution:

Step 1: Calculate the molar mass of aluminum (Al)
- Molar mass of Al = 26.98 g/mol

Step 2: Convert the mass of aluminum to moles
- Moles of Al = 10.0 g ÷ 26.98 g/mol = 0.371 mol

Step 3: Use the mole ratio to determine moles of oxygen
- The ratio of Al:O₂ = 4:3
- Moles of O₂ = 0.371 mol Al × (3 mol O₂ / 4 mol Al) = 0.278 mol O₂

Step 4: Convert moles of oxygen to volume at STP
- Volume of O₂ = 0.278 mol × 22.4 L/mol = 6.23 L

Therefore, 6.23 L of oxygen gas at STP is required to react with 10.0 g of aluminum.

## Calculations Involving Solutions

Many reactions occur in solution. For these, we need to use the concept of molarity (mol/L).

### Key Concept: Molarity
Molarity (M) is defined as moles of solute per liter of solution:
M = moles of solute ÷ liters of solution

### Example Problem 4:
How many mL of 0.250 M HCl solution are needed to completely react with 0.625 g of calcium carbonate according to the reaction: CaCO₃ + 2HCl → CaCl₂ + H₂O + CO₂?

Solution:

Step 1: Calculate the molar mass of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃)
- Ca: 1 × 40.08 g/mol = 40.08 g/mol
- C: 1 × 12.01 g/mol = 12.01 g/mol
- O: 3 × 16.00 g/mol = 48.00 g/mol
- Molar mass of CaCO₃ = 100.09 g/mol

Step 2: Convert the mass of CaCO₃ to moles
- Moles of CaCO₃ = 0.625 g ÷ 100.09 g/mol = 0.00624 mol

Step 3: Use the mole ratio to determine moles of HCl
- The ratio of CaCO₃:HCl = 1:2
- Moles of HCl = 0.00624 mol CaCO₃ × (2 mol HCl / 1 mol CaCO₃) = 0.0125 mol HCl

Step 4: Calculate the volume of HCl solution
- Volume (L) = Moles ÷ Molarity
- Volume = 0.0125 mol ÷ 0.250 mol/L = 0.0500 L = 50.0 mL

Therefore, 50.0 mL of 0.250 M HCl solution is needed.

## Step-by-Step Problem-Solving Strategy

To solve any stoichiometry problem, follow these steps:

1. **Write and balance the chemical equation** for the reaction
2. **Convert given quantities to moles**
   - If given mass: Divide by molar mass
   - If given volume of gas at STP: Divide by 22.4 L/mol
   - If given volume and molarity: Multiply volume (L) by molarity (mol/L)
3. **Use mole ratios** from the balanced equation to convert to moles of the desired substance
4. **Convert to requested units**
   - If mass is required: Multiply moles by molar mass
   - If volume of gas at STP is required: Multiply moles by 22.4 L/mol
   - If volume of solution is required: Divide moles by molarity

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forgetting to balance the equation** - Always start with a properly balanced equation
2. **Using incorrect mole ratios** - Carefully identify the correct substances in the ratio
3. **Inverting the mole ratio** - Make sure the given substance is in the denominator of the ratio
4. **Unit errors** - Keep track of units throughout the calculation
5. **Calculation errors** - Double-check your math, especially when using a calculator
