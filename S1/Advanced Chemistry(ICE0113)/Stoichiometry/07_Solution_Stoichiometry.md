# Solution Stoichiometry

## Introduction to Solution Stoichiometry

Solution stoichiometry involves applying stoichiometric calculations to reactions that occur in aqueous solutions. It combines the principles of stoichiometry with concepts of solution chemistry, particularly the concentration of solutions in terms of molarity. This branch of stoichiometry is especially important in analytical chemistry, biochemistry, and industrial processes where reactions frequently take place in solution.

## Molarity: The Key Concentration Unit

**Molarity (M)** is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution:

Molarity (M) = moles of solute ÷ volume of solution in liters

For example, a 0.500 M NaOH solution contains 0.500 moles of NaOH per liter of solution.

### Calculating Molarity

**Example 1:**
Calculate the molarity of a solution prepared by dissolving 23.4 g of sodium sulfate (Na₂SO₄) in enough water to make 125 mL of solution.

Solution:
Step 1: Calculate moles of sodium sulfate.
- Molar mass of Na₂SO₄ = 2(22.99) + 32.07 + 4(16.00) = 142.05 g/mol
- Moles of Na₂SO₄ = 23.4 g ÷ 142.05 g/mol = 0.165 mol

Step 2: Convert volume to liters.
- Volume = 125 mL = 0.125 L

Step 3: Calculate molarity.
- Molarity = 0.165 mol ÷ 0.125 L = 1.32 M

Therefore, the solution has a concentration of 1.32 M Na₂SO₄.

### Calculating Mass from Molarity

**Example 2:**
How many grams of potassium chloride (KCl) are required to prepare 250 mL of a 0.350 M solution?

Solution:
Step 1: Calculate the moles of KCl needed.
- Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters)
- Moles = 0.350 mol/L × 0.250 L = 0.0875 mol KCl

Step 2: Convert moles to mass.
- Molar mass of KCl = 39.10 + 35.45 = 74.55 g/mol
- Mass = 0.0875 mol × 74.55 g/mol = 6.52 g KCl

## Dilution Calculations

When a concentrated solution is diluted by adding more solvent, the number of moles of solute remains constant. This principle is expressed by the dilution equation:

M₁V₁ = M₂V₂

Where:
- M₁ = initial molarity
- V₁ = initial volume
- M₂ = final molarity
- V₂ = final volume

**Example 3:**
What volume of 6.00 M HCl solution is required to prepare 500 mL of 0.250 M HCl solution?

Solution:
Using the dilution equation: M₁V₁ = M₂V₂

Rearranging to solve for V₁:
V₁ = (M₂V₂) ÷ M₁
V₁ = (0.250 mol/L × 0.500 L) ÷ 6.00 mol/L
V₁ = 0.0208 L = 20.8 mL

Therefore, 20.8 mL of 6.00 M HCl should be diluted to 500 mL to prepare the 0.250 M solution.

## Stoichiometric Calculations in Solution

Solution stoichiometry combines the molarity concept with stoichiometric relationships from balanced chemical equations.

### General Steps for Solution Stoichiometry Problems:

1. Write and balance the chemical equation
2. Convert the given solution information to moles using molarity
3. Use stoichiometric ratios to convert to moles of the desired substance
4. Convert the moles of the desired substance to the requested unit (mass, volume, or concentration)

### Example 4:
What volume of 0.200 M AgNO₃ solution is needed to completely react with 25.0 mL of 0.150 M AlCl₃ solution according to the following reaction?
AlCl₃ + 3AgNO₃ → Al(NO₃)₃ + 3AgCl

Solution:
Step 1: Calculate the moles of AlCl₃.
- Moles of AlCl₃ = 0.150 mol/L × 0.0250 L = 0.00375 mol

Step 2: Use the mole ratio to find moles of AgNO₃ needed.
- From the balanced equation, the mole ratio of AlCl₃:AgNO₃ = 1:3
- Moles of AgNO₃ = 0.00375 mol AlCl₃ × (3 mol AgNO₃ / 1 mol AlCl₃) = 0.01125 mol

Step 3: Calculate the volume of AgNO₃ solution.
- Volume = Moles ÷ Molarity
- Volume = 0.01125 mol ÷ 0.200 mol/L = 0.0563 L = 56.3 mL

Therefore, 56.3 mL of 0.200 M AgNO₃ solution is needed.

## Acid-Base Titrations

Titration is a common laboratory technique used to determine the concentration of a solution by reacting it with a solution of known concentration. Acid-base titrations are particularly important in solution stoichiometry.

### Example 5:
In a titration, 25.0 mL of an HCl solution of unknown concentration was neutralized by 20.3 mL of 0.150 M NaOH solution. Calculate the molarity of the HCl solution.

The balanced equation is: HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H₂O

Solution:
Step 1: Calculate the moles of NaOH used.
- Moles of NaOH = 0.150 mol/L × 0.0203 L = 0.00305 mol

Step 2: Use the mole ratio to find moles of HCl.
- From the balanced equation, the mole ratio of NaOH:HCl = 1:1
- Moles of HCl = 0.00305 mol NaOH × (1 mol HCl / 1 mol NaOH) = 0.00305 mol

Step 3: Calculate the molarity of HCl.
- Molarity = Moles ÷ Volume
- Molarity = 0.00305 mol ÷ 0.0250 L = 0.122 M

Therefore, the HCl solution has a concentration of 0.122 M.

## Precipitation Reactions in Solution

When solutions containing ionic compounds are mixed, precipitation reactions may occur if an insoluble solid forms. Solution stoichiometry helps predict the amount of precipitate formed.

### Example 6:
When solutions containing lead(II) nitrate and sodium iodide are mixed, lead(II) iodide precipitates. Calculate the mass of lead(II) iodide formed when 50.0 mL of 0.100 M lead(II) nitrate is mixed with 75.0 mL of 0.150 M sodium iodide.

The balanced equation is: Pb(NO₃)₂ + 2NaI → PbI₂ + 2NaNO₃

Solution:
Step 1: Calculate the moles of each reactant.
- Moles of Pb(NO₃)₂ = 0.100 mol/L × 0.0500 L = 0.00500 mol
- Moles of NaI = 0.150 mol/L × 0.0750 L = 0.01125 mol

Step 2: Determine the limiting reactant.
- From the balanced equation, 1 mol Pb(NO₃)₂ requires 2 mol NaI
- For 0.00500 mol Pb(NO₃)₂, we need 2 × 0.00500 = 0.0100 mol NaI
- Since 0.01125 mol NaI > 0.0100 mol NaI needed, Pb(NO₃)₂ is the limiting reactant

Step 3: Calculate the moles of PbI₂ formed.
- Moles of PbI₂ = 0.00500 mol Pb(NO₃)₂ × (1 mol PbI₂ / 1 mol Pb(NO₃)₂) = 0.00500 mol

Step 4: Convert to mass of PbI₂.
- Molar mass of PbI₂ = 207.2 + 2(126.9) = 461.0 g/mol
- Mass of PbI₂ = 0.00500 mol × 461.0 g/mol = 2.31 g

Therefore, 2.31 g of lead(II) iodide will precipitate.

## Redox Reactions in Solution

Oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions involve electron transfer between species. Solution stoichiometry for redox reactions often involves titrations, particularly in analytical chemistry.

### Example 7:
In a redox titration, 25.0 mL of a solution containing Fe²⁺ ions required 20.5 mL of 0.0200 M KMnO₄ solution for complete oxidation. Calculate the concentration of Fe²⁺ in the original solution.

The balanced half-reactions in acidic solution are:
- MnO₄⁻ + 8H⁺ + 5e⁻ → Mn²⁺ + 4H₂O
- Fe²⁺ → Fe³⁺ + e⁻

The balanced overall equation is: MnO₄⁻ + 5Fe²⁺ + 8H⁺ → Mn²⁺ + 5Fe³⁺ + 4H₂O

Solution:
Step 1: Calculate the moles of KMnO₄ used.
- Moles of KMnO₄ = 0.0200 mol/L × 0.0205 L = 0.000410 mol

Step 2: Use the mole ratio to find moles of Fe²⁺.
- From the balanced equation, the mole ratio of KMnO₄:Fe²⁺ = 1:5
- Moles of Fe²⁺ = 0.000410 mol KMnO₄ × (5 mol Fe²⁺ / 1 mol KMnO₄) = 0.00205 mol

Step 3: Calculate the molarity of Fe²⁺.
- Molarity = Moles ÷ Volume
- Molarity = 0.00205 mol ÷ 0.0250 L = 0.0820 M

Therefore, the concentration of Fe²⁺ in the original solution is 0.0820 M.
