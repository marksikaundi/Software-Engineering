## The Mole Concept

### Problem 3
Calculate the number of moles in 45.8 g of sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃).

#### Solution:
1. Find the molar mass of Na₂CO₃:
   - 2 × Na = 2 × 22.99 = 45.98 g/mol
   - 1 × C = 1 × 12.01 = 12.01 g/mol
   - 3 × O = 3 × 16.00 = 48.00 g/mol
   - Total molar mass = 106.00 g/mol

2. Calculate moles:
   - Moles = Mass ÷ Molar mass
   - Moles = 45.8 g ÷ 106.00 g/mol = 0.432 mol

Therefore, there are 0.432 moles in 45.8 g of Na₂CO₃.

### Problem 4

#### Solution:
To find the number of molecules, multiply the moles by Avogadro's number (6.022 × 10²³):

Number of molecules = 3.25 mol × 6.022 × 10²³ molecules/mol
Number of molecules = 1.96 × 10²⁴ molecules

## Stoichiometric Calculations

### Problem 5
In the reaction 2Al + 3Cl₂ → 2AlCl₃, how many grams of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃) can be produced from 13.5 g of aluminum?

#### Solution:
1. Find the molar mass of Al:
   - Molar mass of Al = 26.98 g/mol

2. Calculate moles of Al:
   - Moles of Al = 13.5 g ÷ 26.98 g/mol = 0.500 mol

3. Use the mole ratio to calculate moles of AlCl₃:
   - From the balanced equation, 2 mol Al produces 2 mol AlCl₃
   - Mole ratio: Al:AlCl₃ = 2:2 = 1:1
   - Moles of AlCl₃ = 0.500 mol Al × (1 mol AlCl₃ / 1 mol Al) = 0.500 mol

4. Find the molar mass of AlCl₃:
   - Al = 26.98 g/mol
   - Cl = 3 × 35.45 g/mol = 106.35 g/mol
   - Molar mass of AlCl₃ = 133.33 g/mol

5. Calculate the mass of AlCl₃:
   - Mass of AlCl₃ = 0.500 mol × 133.33 g/mol = 66.7 g

Therefore, 13.5 g of aluminum will produce 66.7 g of aluminum chloride.

### Problem 6
What volume of oxygen gas at STP is needed to completely react with 5.00 g of propane (C₃H₈) according to the equation: C₃H₈ + 5O₂ → 3CO₂ + 4H₂O?

#### Solution:
1. Find the molar mass of C₃H₈:
   - C = 3 × 12.01 g/mol = 36.03 g/mol
   - H = 8 × 1.008 g/mol = 8.064 g/mol
   - Molar mass of C₃H₈ = 44.09 g/mol

2. Calculate moles of C₃H₈:
   - Moles of C₃H₈ = 5.00 g ÷ 44.09 g/mol = 0.113 mol

3. Use the mole ratio to calculate moles of O₂:
   - From the balanced equation, 1 mol C₃H₈ requires 5 mol O₂
   - Moles of O₂ = 0.113 mol C₃H₈ × (5 mol O₂ / 1 mol C₃H₈) = 0.567 mol

4. Calculate the volume at STP:
   - Volume of O₂ = 0.567 mol × 22.4 L/mol = 12.7 L

Therefore, 12.7 L of oxygen gas at STP is needed.

## Limiting Reactants

### Problem 7
For the reaction: 2NaOH + H₂SO₄ → Na₂SO₄ + 2H₂O, determine the limiting reactant and calculate the mass of sodium sulfate (Na₂SO₄) formed when 8.00 g of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) reacts with 9.80 g of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).

#### Solution:
1. Calculate moles of each reactant:
   - Molar mass of NaOH = 40.00 g/mol
   - Moles of NaOH = 8.00 g ÷ 40.00 g/mol = 0.200 mol

   - Molar mass of H₂SO₄ = 98.08 g/mol
   - Moles of H₂SO₄ = 9.80 g ÷ 98.08 g/mol = 0.100 mol

2. Compare with the stoichiometric ratio:
   - From the balanced equation, 2 mol NaOH reacts with 1 mol H₂SO₄
   - Required moles of H₂SO₄ for 0.200 mol NaOH = 0.200 mol ÷ 2 = 0.100 mol
   - Since 0.100 mol of H₂SO₄ is available, exactly the required amount is present
   - In this case, both reactants will be completely consumed (neither is limiting)

3. Calculate moles of Na₂SO₄ formed:
   - From the balanced equation, 1 mol H₂SO₄ produces 1 mol Na₂SO₄
   - Moles of Na₂SO₄ = 0.100 mol H₂SO₄ × (1 mol Na₂SO₄ / 1 mol H₂SO₄) = 0.100 mol

4. Calculate mass of Na₂SO₄:
   - Molar mass of Na₂SO₄ = 2(22.99) + 32.07 + 4(16.00) = 142.05 g/mol
   - Mass of Na₂SO₄ = 0.100 mol × 142.05 g/mol = 14.2 g

Therefore, 14.2 g of sodium sulfate will be formed.

### Problem 8
In the reaction: 2Al + 3CuSO₄ → Al₂(SO₄)₃ + 3Cu, if 5.40 g of aluminum reacts with 25.0 g of copper(II) sulfate, determine:
a) The limiting reactant
b) The mass of copper formed
c) The mass of excess reactant remaining

#### Solution:
1. Calculate moles of each reactant:
   - Molar mass of Al = 26.98 g/mol
   - Moles of Al = 5.40 g ÷ 26.98 g/mol = 0.200 mol

   - Molar mass of CuSO₄ = 159.61 g/mol
   - Moles of CuSO₄ = 25.0 g ÷ 159.61 g/mol = 0.157 mol

2. Determine the limiting reactant:
   - From the balanced equation, 2 mol Al reacts with 3 mol CuSO₄
   - For 0.200 mol Al, required CuSO₄ = 0.200 mol × (3/2) = 0.300 mol
   - Since only 0.157 mol CuSO₄ is available, CuSO₄ is the limiting reactant

3. Calculate moles of Cu formed:
   - From the balanced equation, 3 mol CuSO₄ produces 3 mol Cu
   - Moles of Cu = 0.157 mol CuSO₄ × (3 mol Cu / 3 mol CuSO₄) = 0.157 mol

4. Calculate mass of Cu:
   - Molar mass of Cu = 63.55 g/mol
   - Mass of Cu = 0.157 mol × 63.55 g/mol = 9.98 g

5. Calculate the amount of excess Al remaining:
   - Al required for 0.157 mol CuSO₄ = 0.157 mol × (2/3) = 0.105 mol
   - Al remaining = 0.200 mol - 0.105 mol = 0.095 mol
   - Mass of Al remaining = 0.095 mol × 26.98 g/mol = 2.56 g

Therefore:
a) CuSO₄ is the limiting reactant
b) 9.98 g of copper will be formed
c) 2.56 g of aluminum will remain unreacted

## Percent Yield

### Problem 9
In the reaction: 2KClO₃ → 2KCl + 3O₂, 12.2 g of potassium chlorate (KClO₃) was heated and 4.25 L of oxygen gas was collected at STP. Calculate the percent yield of oxygen.

#### Solution:
1. Calculate moles of KClO₃:
   - Molar mass of KClO₃ = 122.55 g/mol
   - Moles of KClO₃ = 12.2 g ÷ 122.55 g/mol = 0.0996 mol

2. Calculate theoretical moles of O₂:
   - From the balanced equation, 2 mol KClO₃ produces 3 mol O₂
   - Moles of O₂ = 0.0996 mol KClO₃ × (3 mol O₂ / 2 mol KClO₃) = 0.149 mol

3. Calculate theoretical volume of O₂ at STP:
   - Volume = 0.149 mol × 22.4 L/mol = 3.34 L

4. Calculate percent yield:
   - Percent yield = (Actual yield ÷ Theoretical yield) × 100%
   - Percent yield = (4.25 L ÷ 3.34 L) × 100% = 127%

The percent yield exceeds 100%, which suggests experimental error. This could be due to measurement errors, impurities in the sample, or other gases being produced.

### Problem 10
When 25.0 g of calcium carbonate is heated according to the reaction: CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂, 12.5 g of calcium oxide is produced. Calculate the percent yield.

#### Solution:
1. Calculate moles of CaCO₃:
   - Molar mass of CaCO₃ = 100.09 g/mol
   - Moles of CaCO₃ = 25.0 g ÷ 100.09 g/mol = 0.250 mol

2. Calculate theoretical moles of CaO:
   - From the balanced equation, 1 mol CaCO₃ produces 1 mol CaO
   - Moles of CaO = 0.250 mol CaCO₃ × (1 mol CaO / 1 mol CaCO₃) = 0.250 mol

3. Calculate theoretical mass of CaO:
   - Molar mass of CaO = 56.08 g/mol
   - Theoretical mass of CaO = 0.250 mol × 56.08 g/mol = 14.0 g

4. Calculate percent yield:
   - Percent yield = (Actual yield ÷ Theoretical yield) × 100%
   - Percent yield = (12.5 g ÷ 14.0 g) × 100% = 89.3%

Therefore, the percent yield is 89.3%.

## Solution Stoichiometry

### Problem 11
What volume of 0.200 M silver nitrate (AgNO₃) solution is needed to completely react with 25.0 mL of 0.150 M sodium chloride (NaCl) solution according to the reaction: AgNO₃ + NaCl → AgCl + NaNO₃?

#### Solution:
1. Calculate moles of NaCl:
   - Moles of NaCl = 0.150 M × 0.0250 L = 0.00375 mol

2. Use the mole ratio to find moles of AgNO₃:
   - From the balanced equation, the mole ratio of NaCl:AgNO₃ = 1:1
   - Moles of AgNO₃ = 0.00375 mol NaCl × (1 mol AgNO₃ / 1 mol NaCl) = 0.00375 mol

3. Calculate volume of AgNO₃ solution:
   - Volume = Moles ÷ Molarity
   - Volume = 0.00375 mol ÷ 0.200 M = 0.01875 L = 18.8 mL

Therefore, 18.8 mL of 0.200 M AgNO₃ solution is needed.

### Problem 12
A 25.0 mL sample of sulfuric acid was titrated with 0.100 M sodium hydroxide solution. If 35.2 mL of NaOH solution was required to reach the endpoint, what is the molarity of the H₂SO₄ solution? The balanced equation is: H₂SO₄ + 2NaOH → Na₂SO₄ + 2H₂O

#### Solution:
1. Calculate moles of NaOH used:
   - Moles of NaOH = 0.100 M × 0.0352 L = 0.00352 mol

2. Use the mole ratio to find moles of H₂SO₄:
   - From the balanced equation, 2 mol NaOH reacts with 1 mol H₂SO₄
   - Moles of H₂SO₄ = 0.00352 mol NaOH × (1 mol H₂SO₄ / 2 mol NaOH) = 0.00176 mol

3. Calculate the molarity of H₂SO₄:
   - Molarity = Moles ÷ Volume
   - Molarity = 0.00176 mol ÷ 0.0250 L = 0.0704 M

Therefore, the concentration of the H₂SO₄ solution is 0.0704 M.

## Comprehensive Problems

### Problem 13

c) If the actual yield of ammonia is 14.5 g, what is the percent yield?

#### Solution:
1. Calculate moles of each reactant:
   - Molar mass of N₂ = 28.02 g/mol
   - Moles of N₂ = 28.0 g ÷ 28.02 g/mol = 0.999 mol

   - Molar mass of H₂ = 2.016 g/mol
   - Moles of H₂ = 6.00 g ÷ 2.016 g/mol = 2.98 mol

2. Determine the limiting reactant:
   - From the balanced equation, 1 mol N₂ requires 3 mol H₂
   - H₂ required for 0.999 mol N₂ = 0.999 mol × 3 = 2.997 mol
   - Since only 2.98 mol H₂ is available, H₂ is the limiting reactant

3. Calculate theoretical moles of NH₃:
   - From the balanced equation, 3 mol H₂ produces 2 mol NH₃
   - Moles of NH₃ = 2.98 mol H₂ × (2 mol NH₃ / 3 mol H₂) = 1.99 mol

4. Calculate theoretical mass of NH₃:
   - Molar mass of NH₃ = 17.03 g/mol
   - Theoretical mass of NH₃ = 1.99 mol × 17.03 g/mol = 33.9 g

5. Calculate percent yield:
   - Percent yield = (Actual yield ÷ Theoretical yield) × 100%
   - Percent yield = (14.5 g ÷ 33.9 g) × 100% = 42.8%

Therefore:
a) Hydrogen is the limiting reactant
b) The maximum theoretical yield of ammonia is 33.9 g
c) The percent yield is 42.8%

### Problem 14
Hydrogen peroxide decomposes according to the reaction: 2H₂O₂ → 2H₂O + O₂. A 50.0 mL solution of 0.200 M H₂O₂ is allowed to decompose.

a) How many moles of H₂O₂ are present initially?
b) How many moles of O₂ will be produced?
c) What volume of O₂ gas will be collected at 25°C and 1.00 atm? (R = 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K)

#### Solution:
1. Calculate initial moles of H₂O₂:
   - Moles of H₂O₂ = 0.200 M × 0.0500 L = 0.0100 mol

2. Calculate moles of O₂ produced:
   - From the balanced equation, 2 mol H₂O₂ produces 1 mol O₂
   - Moles of O₂ = 0.0100 mol H₂O₂ × (1 mol O₂ / 2 mol H₂O₂) = 0.00500 mol

3. Calculate volume of O₂ using the ideal gas law: PV = nRT
   - Rearranging to solve for V: V = nRT/P
   - V = (0.00500 mol × 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K × 298 K) ÷ 1.00 atm
   - V = 0.122 L = 122 mL

Therefore:
a) 0.0100 mol of H₂O₂ is present initially
b) 0.00500 mol of O₂ will be produced
c) 122 mL of O₂ gas will be collected at 25°C and 1.00 atm

### Problem 15
A mixture of calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate with a total mass of 10.0 g was heated strongly to convert both carbonates to their respective oxides (CaO and MgO). The mass of the resulting solid mixture was 5.60 g.

a) Write balanced equations for both decomposition reactions
b) Calculate the mass of CO₂ produced
c) Calculate the composition of the original mixture (mass percentage of each carbonate)

#### Solution:
1. Write balanced equations:
   - CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂
   - MgCO₃ → MgO + CO₂

2. Calculate mass of CO₂ produced:
   - Mass of CO₂ = Initial mass - Final mass = 10.0 g - 5.60 g = 4.40 g

3. Let x be the mass of CaCO₃ and (10.0 - x) be the mass of MgCO₃
   - Molar mass of CaCO₃ = 100.09 g/mol
   - Molar mass of CaO = 56.08 g/mol
   - Molar mass of CO₂ = 44.01 g/mol
   - Molar mass of MgCO₃ = 84.31 g/mol
   - Molar mass of MgO = 40.30 g/mol

4. For CaCO₃ decomposition:
   - Mass of CaO from x g CaCO₃ = x × (56.08/100.09) g
   - Mass of CO₂ from x g CaCO₃ = x × (44.01/100.09) g

5. For MgCO₃ decomposition:
   - Mass of MgO from (10.0 - x) g MgCO₃ = (10.0 - x) × (40.30/84.31) g
   - Mass of CO₂ from (10.0 - x) g MgCO₃ = (10.0 - x) × (44.01/84.31) g

6. Set up equation for the final mass:
   - 5.60 g = x × (56.08/100.09) + (10.0 - x) × (40.30/84.31)
   - Solve for x:
   - 5.60 = 0.5603x + 4.780 - 0.4779x
   - 5.60 = 0.0824x + 4.780
   - 0.0824x = 0.820
   - x = 9.95 g

7. This means:
   - Mass of CaCO₃ ≈ 9.95 g
   - Mass of MgCO₃ ≈ 0.05 g (essentially zero within experimental error)

Therefore:
a) The balanced equations are CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂ and MgCO₃ → MgO + CO₂
b) 4.40 g of CO₂ was produced
c) The original mixture contained approximately 99.5% CaCO₃ and 0.5% MgCO₃

Note: This result suggests the sample was almost pure calcium carbonate. To verify, we can check that 10.0 g of pure CaCO₃ would produce 5.60 g of CaO and 4.40 g of CO₂, which matches our result.
