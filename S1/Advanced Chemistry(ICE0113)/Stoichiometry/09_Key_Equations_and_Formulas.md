# Key Equations and Formulas for Stoichiometry

## The Mole Concept

### Avogadro's Number
- Number of entities = Number of moles × Avogadro's number
- Number of moles = Number of entities ÷ Avogadro's number
- Avogadro's number = 6.022 × 10²³ entities/mol

### Molar Mass
- Molar mass = Sum of atomic masses of all atoms in a molecule (g/mol)

### Converting Between Mass and Moles
- Number of moles = Mass of substance (g) ÷ Molar mass (g/mol)
- Mass of substance (g) = Number of moles × Molar mass (g/mol)

## Stoichiometric Calculations

### Mole-to-Mole Conversions
- Moles of B = Moles of A × (Mole ratio of B to A from balanced equation)
- Mole ratio = (Coefficient of substance in balanced equation) ÷ (Coefficient of reference substance)

### Mass-to-Mass Conversions
- Mass of B = Mass of A × (Molar mass of B ÷ Molar mass of A) × (Coefficient of B ÷ Coefficient of A)

### Gas Stoichiometry at STP
- Volume of gas at STP = Number of moles × 22.4 L/mol

### Ideal Gas Law (for non-STP conditions)
- PV = nRT
- V = nRT/P
  - P = pressure (atm)
  - V = volume (L)
  - n = number of moles
  - R = gas constant (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K)
  - T = temperature (K)

## Limiting Reactant Calculations

### Determining the Limiting Reactant
- Calculate theoretical yield from each reactant
- The reactant producing the least amount of product is the limiting reactant

### Excess Reactant Remaining
- Moles remaining = Initial moles of excess reactant - Moles of excess reactant consumed

## Percent Yield

### Percent Yield Calculation
- Percent yield = (Actual yield ÷ Theoretical yield) × 100%

## Solution Stoichiometry

### Molarity
- Molarity (M) = Moles of solute ÷ Volume of solution (L)
- Moles of solute = Molarity × Volume (L)

### Dilution
- M₁V₁ = M₂V₂
  - M₁ = initial molarity
  - V₁ = initial volume
  - M₂ = final molarity
  - V₂ = final volume

### Solution Stoichiometry
- Moles of reactant in solution = Volume of solution (L) × Molarity (mol/L)

## General Conversion Factors

### Mass Conversions
- 1 kg = 1000 g
- 1 g = 1000 mg

### Volume Conversions
- 1 L = 1000 mL
- 1 mL = 1 cm³

### Temperature Conversions
- K = °C + 273.15
- °C = (°F - 32) × 5/9
- °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32

### Pressure Conversions
- 1 atm = 760 mmHg = 760 torr = 101.325 kPa
- 1 bar = 0.987 atm
