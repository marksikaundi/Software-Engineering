# Balanced Chemical Equations

## Law of Conservation of Mass

The fundamental principle underlying balanced chemical equations is the **Law of Conservation of Mass**, first formulated by Antoine Lavoisier in the 18th century. This law states that:

> In a chemical reaction, matter is neither created nor destroyed.

This means the total mass of all substances before a reaction equals the total mass of all substances after the reaction. In terms of atoms, the same number and types of atoms must be present before and after a reaction, though they may be arranged differently.

## Writing Chemical Equations

Chemical equations are shorthand representations of chemical reactions using chemical symbols and formulas. A properly written chemical equation shows:

1. **Reactants**: The starting substances (left side of the equation)
2. **Products**: The substances formed (right side of the equation)
3. **States of matter**: Often shown in parentheses
   - (s) = solid
   - (l) = liquid
   - (g) = gas
   - (aq) = aqueous solution (dissolved in water)
4. **Reaction conditions**: Sometimes written above or below the reaction arrow
   - Temperature
   - Pressure
   - Catalysts
5. **Direction of reaction**: Indicated by arrow types
   - → (single arrow): Reaction proceeds primarily in one direction
   - ⇌ (double arrow): Reversible reaction

### Example of an unbalanced equation:
H₂ + O₂ → H₂O

### The same equation after balancing:
2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O

## Balancing Chemical Equations

Balancing a chemical equation involves adjusting the coefficients (the numbers placed before formulas) so that there are equal numbers of each type of atom on both sides of the equation. The subscripts within chemical formulas must never be changed as this would represent a different substance.

### Step-by-Step Method for Balancing Equations:

1. **Count atoms**: Identify the number of atoms of each element on both sides of the equation
2. **Choose a starting element**: Typically begin with the most complex molecule or an element that appears in only one reactant and one product
3. **Balance systematically**: Add coefficients to balance one element at a time
4. **Verify**: Check that all elements are balanced
5. **Simplify**: Reduce all coefficients to the smallest whole-number ratio if needed

### Example: Balancing C₃H₈ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O

Step 1: Count the atoms
- Reactants: 3 C, 8 H, 2 O
- Products: 1 C, 2 H, 3 O

Step 2: Start with carbon (C)
- We need 3 CO₂ on the right to match the 3 C atoms on the left
- C₃H₈ + O₂ → 3CO₂ + H₂O

Step 3: Balance hydrogen (H)
- We have 8 H atoms on the left, so we need 8 H atoms on the right
- That means 4 H₂O molecules
- C₃H₈ + O₂ → 3CO₂ + 4H₂O

Step 4: Balance oxygen (O)
- Right side: 3(2) + 4(1) = 10 O atoms
- Left side: 2 O atoms
- Need 5 O₂ molecules on the left
- C₃H₈ + 5O₂ → 3CO₂ + 4H₂O

Step 5: Verify all atoms are balanced
- C: 3 = 3
- H: 8 = 8
- O: 10 = 10

The balanced equation is: C₃H₈ + 5O₂ → 3CO₂ + 4H₂O

## Significance of Coefficients in Balanced Equations

The coefficients in a balanced equation have critical significance:

1. **Mole ratios**: They represent the mole-to-mole relationships between reactants and products
2. **Reaction stoichiometry**: They allow quantitative calculations of amounts involved in reactions
3. **Molecular/formula units**: They indicate the relative number of molecules, atoms, or formula units

For example, in the equation 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O:
- 2 moles of H₂ react with 1 mole of O₂ to produce 2 moles of H₂O
- The mole ratio of H₂ to O₂ is 2:1
- The mole ratio of O₂ to H₂O is 1:2
- The mole ratio of H₂ to H₂O is 1:1

These mole ratios are the foundation for all stoichiometric calculations.

## Common Types of Chemical Reactions

Understanding the types of reactions helps in predicting products and balancing equations:

1. **Combination/Synthesis**: A + B → AB
   - Example: 2Na + Cl₂ → 2NaCl

2. **Decomposition**: AB → A + B
   - Example: 2H₂O → 2H₂ + O₂

3. **Single Replacement**: A + BC → AC + B
   - Example: Zn + 2HCl → ZnCl₂ + H₂

4. **Double Replacement**: AB + CD → AD + CB
   - Example: AgNO₃ + NaCl → AgCl + NaNO₃

5. **Combustion**: Hydrocarbon + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O
   - Example: CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O
