# Percent Yield

## Introduction to Percent Yield

In ideal situations, chemical reactions would produce exactly the amount of product predicted by stoichiometric calculations (the theoretical yield). However, in real laboratory and industrial settings, the actual amount of product obtained (the actual yield) is almost always less than the theoretical yield. The **percent yield** provides a way to express the efficiency of a chemical reaction.

Percent yield is defined as the ratio of the actual yield to the theoretical yield, expressed as a percentage:

Percent yield = (Actual yield ÷ Theoretical yield) × 100%

## Theoretical Yield vs. Actual Yield

### Theoretical Yield
The **theoretical yield** is the maximum amount of product that could be formed from the given quantities of reactants, as calculated using stoichiometry. It assumes:
- The reaction goes to completion
- No side reactions occur
- No product is lost during recovery

### Actual Yield
The **actual yield** is the amount of product actually obtained from the reaction. It is determined by weighing the isolated, purified product.

## Calculating Percent Yield

The process for calculating percent yield follows these steps:
1. Calculate the theoretical yield based on the limiting reactant
2. Measure the actual yield obtained from the experiment
3. Apply the percent yield formula

### Example 1:
In a laboratory experiment, 10.0 g of calcium carbonate is decomposed according to the reaction:
CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂

The experiment yields 5.2 g of calcium oxide (CaO). Calculate the percent yield.

Solution:
Step 1: Calculate the theoretical yield of CaO.
- Molar mass of CaCO₃ = 100.1 g/mol
- Molar mass of CaO = 56.1 g/mol
- Moles of CaCO₃ = 10.0 g ÷ 100.1 g/mol = 0.0999 mol
- According to the balanced equation, 1 mol CaCO₃ yields 1 mol CaO
- Theoretical yield of CaO = 0.0999 mol × 56.1 g/mol = 5.60 g

Step 2: Calculate the percent yield.
- Actual yield of CaO = 5.2 g
- Percent yield = (5.2 g ÷ 5.60 g) × 100% = 92.9%

### Example 2:
In the synthesis of aspirin (C₉H₈O₄) from salicylic acid (C₇H₆O₃) and acetic anhydride (C₄H₆O₃):
C₇H₆O₃ + C₄H₆O₃ → C₉H₈O₄ + HC₂H₃O₂

If 5.00 g of salicylic acid reacts with excess acetic anhydride and 4.25 g of aspirin is recovered, what is the percent yield?

Solution:
Step 1: Calculate the theoretical yield of aspirin.
- Molar mass of C₇H₆O₃ (salicylic acid) = 138.1 g/mol
- Molar mass of C₉H₈O₄ (aspirin) = 180.2 g/mol
- Moles of salicylic acid = 5.00 g ÷ 138.1 g/mol = 0.0362 mol
- According to the balanced equation, 1 mol salicylic acid yields 1 mol aspirin
- Theoretical yield of aspirin = 0.0362 mol × 180.2 g/mol = 6.52 g

Step 2: Calculate the percent yield.
- Actual yield of aspirin = 4.25 g
- Percent yield = (4.25 g ÷ 6.52 g) × 100% = 65.2%

## Factors Affecting Yield in Chemical Reactions

Several factors can cause the actual yield to be less than the theoretical yield:

### 1. Competing Side Reactions
- Secondary reactions may consume reactants or products
- Example: In the Haber process for ammonia synthesis (N₂ + 3H₂ → 2NH₃), side reactions can occur with oxygen impurities

### 2. Reversible Reactions
- If a reaction doesn't go to completion due to an equilibrium state
- Example: Esterification reactions (acid + alcohol ⇌ ester + water) reach equilibrium before completion

### 3. Incomplete Reactions
- Reactions may stop before all limiting reactant is consumed
- Example: Slow reaction kinetics or insufficient reaction time

### 4. Product Loss During Recovery
- Mechanical losses during filtration, transfer, or crystallization
- Solubility losses during extraction or washing
- Volatilization of products

### 5. Impure Reactants
- Impurities in starting materials lead to lower effective concentration
- Example: Technical-grade chemicals vs. analytical-grade chemicals

### 6. Experimental Technique
- Poor mixing, improper temperature control
- Inefficient separation methods
- Measurement errors

## Significance of Percent Yield

The percent yield serves several important functions in chemistry:

### 1. Measure of Reaction Efficiency
- Higher percent yields indicate more efficient processes
- Industrial processes aim to maximize yields to reduce costs

### 2. Assessment of Experimental Technique
- Comparing your yield to literature values helps evaluate your technique
- Consistently low yields may indicate procedural problems

### 3. Economic Considerations
- In industrial processes, even small improvements in yield can have significant economic benefits
- Example: A 1% yield improvement in pharmaceutical manufacturing can save millions of dollars

### 4. Environmental Impact
- Higher yields mean less waste and more efficient use of resources
- Green chemistry principles emphasize yield optimization

## Percent Yield in Industrial Applications

In industrial settings, percent yield is crucial for process economics:

### Pharmaceutical Industry
- Complex syntheses often involve multiple steps
- Overall yield = product of individual step yields
- Example: A 10-step synthesis with 80% yield at each step results in an overall yield of only 10.7%

### Petroleum Industry
- Catalytic cracking processes are optimized for specific product yields
- Slight improvements in yield have enormous economic impact due to scale

### Chemical Manufacturing
- Batch-to-batch consistency in yield is monitored for quality control
- Process optimization focuses on maximizing yield while minimizing costs

## Percent Purity and Its Relationship to Yield

The purity of a product is often related to yield:
- Higher purity requirements may result in lower yields due to purification losses
- Lower purity may give higher yields but less valuable products

The percent purity can be determined through various analytical methods:
- Melting point or boiling point determination
- Chromatographic analysis
- Spectroscopic techniques

## Practice Problems
