# The Mole Concept and Stoichiometry

## The Mole as a Counting Unit

In chemistry, we often deal with incredibly large numbers of atoms and molecules that are too small to see or count individually. The **mole** provides a bridge between the microscopic world of atoms and molecules and the macroscopic world we can observe and measure.

A **mole** is defined as the amount of substance that contains exactly 6.022 × 10²³ elementary entities (atoms, molecules, ions, or other particles). This number is known as **Avogadro's number** or **Avogadro's constant**, named after the Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro.

### Analogies for Understanding the Mole

To grasp the immense size of Avogadro's number:
- If you had Avogadro's number of pennies, they would cover the Earth's surface to a depth of about 300 kilometers
- If you counted atoms at the rate of one per second, it would take you over 19 quadrillion years to count the atoms in one mole
- One mole of marbles would cover the entire United States to a depth of about 5 kilometers

## Avogadro's Number (6.022 × 10²³)

Avogadro's number serves as a conversion factor between the number of entities and moles:

Number of entities = Number of moles × Avogadro's number

For example:
- 1 mole of water (H₂O) contains 6.022 × 10²³ molecules of H₂O
- 1 mole of sodium atoms contains 6.022 × 10²³ sodium atoms
- 2 moles of carbon dioxide contain 2 × (6.022 × 10²³) = 1.204 × 10²⁴ CO₂ molecules

### Significance in Chemistry

The mole concept is crucial because:
1. It allows us to count atoms and molecules by weighing them
2. It connects the mass of a substance to the number of atoms or molecules it contains
3. It provides a standard quantity for comparing different substances in chemical reactions

## Molar Mass Calculations

The **molar mass** of a substance is the mass of one mole of that substance, typically expressed in grams per mole (g/mol).

### For Elements

The molar mass of an element equals its atomic mass from the periodic table in grams per mole.

Examples:
- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol
- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol
- Iron (Fe): 55.85 g/mol

### For Compounds

The molar mass of a compound equals the sum of the molar masses of all atoms in its chemical formula.

Example: Calculate the molar mass of H₂O
- 2 H atoms: 2 × 1.008 g/mol = 2.016 g/mol
- 1 O atom: 1 × 16.00 g/mol = 16.00 g/mol
- Total molar mass of H₂O = 2.016 g/mol + 16.00 g/mol = 18.02 g/mol

Example: Calculate the molar mass of H₂SO₄
- 2 H atoms: 2 × 1.008 g/mol = 2.016 g/mol
- 1 S atom: 1 × 32.07 g/mol = 32.07 g/mol
- 4 O atoms: 4 × 16.00 g/mol = 64.00 g/mol
- Total molar mass of H₂SO₄ = 2.016 + 32.07 + 64.00 = 98.09 g/mol

## Converting Between Mass and Moles

The relationship between mass and moles is given by:

Number of moles = Mass of substance (g) ÷ Molar mass (g/mol)

Mass of substance (g) = Number of moles × Molar mass (g/mol)

### Examples:

1. **Convert 35.0 g of copper (Cu) to moles**
   - Molar mass of Cu = 63.55 g/mol
   - Moles of Cu = 35.0 g ÷ 63.55 g/mol = 0.551 mol

2. **Convert 2.50 mol of carbon dioxide (CO₂) to grams**
   - Molar mass of CO₂ = 12.01 g/mol + 2(16.00 g/mol) = 44.01 g/mol
   - Mass of CO₂ = 2.50 mol × 44.01 g/mol = 110 g

## The Mole in Chemical Equations

In a balanced chemical equation, the coefficients represent the relative numbers of moles of each substance involved in the reaction.

For example, in the reaction: 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O
- 2 moles of H₂ react with 1 mole of O₂ to form 2 moles of H₂O
- This establishes molar ratios: H₂:O₂ = 2:1, H₂:H₂O = 2:2 = 1:1, O₂:H₂O = 1:2

These mole ratios are the foundation of stoichiometry and allow us to determine the quantities of reactants and products in chemical reactions.

## Mole-to-Mole Conversions

To convert from moles of one substance to moles of another in a chemical reaction:

1. Write the balanced chemical equation
2. Identify the mole ratio between the given substance and the desired substance
3. Multiply the given number of moles by this mole ratio

### Example:
How many moles of water (H₂O) can be produced from 3.00 moles of hydrogen gas (H₂)?

Step 1: Write the balanced equation
2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O

Step 2: Identify the mole ratio
The mole ratio of H₂ to H₂O is 2:2 or 1:1

Step 3: Multiply the given moles by the mole ratio
3.00 mol H₂ × (1 mol H₂O / 1 mol H₂) = 3.00 mol H₂O

## Mole-to-Mass and Mass-to-Mole Conversions in Stoichiometry

In most practical situations, we measure masses rather than count molecules directly. Stoichiometric calculations therefore often involve converting:
1. From mass of a reactant to moles
2. From moles of reactant to moles of product (using mole ratios)
3. From moles of product to mass of product

### General Procedure for Stoichiometric Calculations:

Given mass of A → moles of A → moles of B → mass of B

Where:
- A is the substance you start with
- B is the substance you want to find

### Example Problem:
How many grams of oxygen (O₂) are required to completely react with 35.0 g of propane (C₃H₈)?

Step 1: Write the balanced equation
C₃H₈ + 5O₂ → 3CO₂ + 4H₂O

Step 2: Convert given mass to moles
Molar mass of C₃H₈ = 3(12.01) + 8(1.008) = 44.09 g/mol
Moles of C₃H₈ = 35.0 g ÷ 44.09 g/mol = 0.794 mol

Step 3: Use the mole ratio to determine moles of desired substance
The mole ratio of C₃H₈ to O₂ is 1:5
Moles of O₂ = 0.794 mol C₃H₈ × (5 mol O₂ / 1 mol C₃H₈) = 3.97 mol O₂

Step 4: Convert moles of desired substance to mass
Molar mass of O₂ = 2(16.00) = 32.00 g/mol
Mass of O₂ = 3.97 mol × 32.00 g/mol = 127 g O₂

## Practice Problems

1. Calculate the number of moles in 75.0 g of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃).

2. How many molecules are there in 2.50 moles of glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆)?

3. Calculate the mass of 0.350 moles of aluminum sulfate [Al₂(SO₄)₃].

4. In the reaction 2Al + 6HCl → 2AlCl₃ + 3H₂, how many moles of HCl are needed to react with 0.75 mol of aluminum?

5. How many grams of iron(III) oxide (Fe₂O₃) can be produced from 85.0 g of iron in the reaction: 4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃?
