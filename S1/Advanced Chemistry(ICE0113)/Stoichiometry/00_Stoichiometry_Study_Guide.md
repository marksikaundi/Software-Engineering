# Stoichiometry Study Guide

## Overview
This study guide covers the fundamentals of stoichiometry based on readings from:
- "Fundamentals of Chemistry" by David Goldberg (pages 193-208)
- "Chemical Principles" by Steven Zumdahl (pages 51-76)

## Key Topics

### 1. Introduction to Stoichiometry
- Definition and etymology (from Greek "stoicheion" meaning "element" and "metron" meaning "measure")
- Importance in chemistry and real-world applications

### 2. Balanced Chemical Equations
- Law of Conservation of Mass
- Writing and balancing chemical equations
- Significance of coefficients in balanced equations

### 3. The Mole Concept and Stoichiometry
- Mole as a counting unit
- Avogadro's number (6.022 Ã— 10^23)
- Molar mass calculations
- Converting between mass and moles

### 4. Stoichiometric Calculations
- Mole-to-mole conversions
- Mass-to-mass conversions
- Step-by-step problem-solving strategies

### 5. Limiting Reactants
- Identifying limiting reactants
- Calculating theoretical yield
- Excess reactants

### 6. Percent Yield
- Theoretical vs. actual yield
- Calculating percent yield
- Factors affecting yield in chemical reactions

### 7. Solution Stoichiometry
- Molarity
- Solution concentration calculations
- Dilution problems

## Study Resources
