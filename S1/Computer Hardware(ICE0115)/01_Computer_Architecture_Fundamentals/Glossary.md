# Computer Architecture Fundamentals: Glossary

## A

**Address Bus**: A unidirectional communication pathway that carries memory addresses from the CPU to memory and I/O devices. The width of the address bus determines the maximum amount of memory a system can address.

**Addressing Mode**: The method used to calculate the effective memory address of an operand. Common modes include immediate, direct, indirect, register, and indexed addressing.

**Architecture**: The design and structure of a computer system, including its components, their functions, and how they interact.

**ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit)**: An integrated circuit designed for a specific purpose rather than general-purpose use.

## B

**Binary**: A base-2 number system that uses only two symbols, typically 0 and 1, to represent all values. Fundamental to all digital computer systems.

**BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)**: Firmware that initializes hardware during the booting process and provides runtime services for operating systems and programs.

**Bit**: The smallest unit of data in computing, representing a single binary digit (0 or 1).

**Boolean Algebra**: A branch of algebra where the values of variables are true and false, typically denoted as 1 and 0 respectively. Forms the mathematical basis of digital logic.

**Bus**: A communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer or between computers.

**Byte**: A unit of digital information that consists of 8 bits.

## C

**Cache Memory**: High-speed memory that stores frequently accessed data to reduce the time required to access data from the main memory.

**Cache Coherence**: A consistency mechanism that ensures that changes in the values of shared operands are propagated throughout the system in a timely fashion.

**CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)**: A processor design philosophy that includes a large set of complex instructions that may take multiple clock cycles to execute.

**Clock Cycle**: The time interval between two adjacent pulses of the oscillator that sets the tempo of the computer processor.

**Combinational Circuit**: A digital circuit whose output depends only on its current inputs, without any memory of past inputs.

**Control Bus**: A bidirectional pathway that carries control signals between the CPU and other devices.

**Control Unit**: The part of the CPU that directs operations of the processor, managing the execution of instructions.

**CPU (Central Processing Unit)**: The primary component of a computer that performs most processing. It consists of the ALU, control unit, and registers.

## D

**Data Bus**: A bidirectional pathway that transfers data between the CPU, memory, and other components.

**Direct Memory Access (DMA)**: A feature that allows certain hardware subsystems to access main system memory independently of the CPU.

## F

**Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle**: The basic operational cycle of a CPU, consisting of fetching an instruction from memory, decoding it to determine the required operation, and executing the instruction.

**Flip-flop**: A circuit that can store a single bit of data (either 0 or 1) and serves as the basic storage element in sequential logic.

**FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array)**: An integrated circuit designed to be configured after manufacturing, allowing for hardware-level reconfiguration.

## H

**Harvard Architecture**: A computer architecture with physically separate storage and signal pathways for instructions and data, allowing simultaneous access.

**Hexadecimal (Hex)**: A base-16 number system using digits 0-9 and letters A-F. Often used to represent binary values more concisely in computing.

## I

**Instruction Cycle**: The process by which a CPU retrieves an instruction from memory, determines what actions the instruction requires, and carries out those actions.

**Instruction Pipeline**: A technique used in CPU design to increase instruction throughput by overlapping the execution of multiple instructions.

**Instruction Set**: The complete set of instructions that a CPU can execute, defining the CPU's functionality.

**Interrupt**: A signal to the processor indicating that an event requires immediate attention, causing a temporary halt to normal program execution.

**I/O (Input/Output)**: The communication between a computer and the outside world, including devices like keyboards, displays, and storage.

## L

**Logic Gate**: An electronic device implementing a Boolean function, performing a logical operation on one or more binary inputs to produce a single binary output.

## M

**Memory Hierarchy**: The hierarchical arrangement of storage in a computer system, from fastest but smallest/most expensive (registers, cache) to slowest but largest/least expensive (secondary storage).

**MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second)**: A measure of a computer's processing speed.

**Moore's Law**: An observation by Gordon Moore that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years.

**Multicore Processor**: A processor with multiple processing cores on a single chip, capable of executing multiple instructions simultaneously.

## O

**Opcode (Operation Code)**: The portion of a machine language instruction that specifies the operation to be performed.

**Operating System**: System software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

**Out-of-order Execution**: A paradigm used in CPU design to utilize instruction cycles that would otherwise be wasted by data dependencies or other delays.

## P

**Parallel Processing**: The simultaneous use of multiple processing elements to solve a computational problem.

**Pipelining**: A technique where multiple instructions are overlapped in execution to increase throughput.

**Program Counter (PC)**: A processor register that indicates where a computer is in its program sequence, containing the memory address of the next instruction to be executed.

## R

**Register**: A small amount of fast storage available within the CPU for storing temporary data during processing.

**RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)**: A CPU design philosophy that uses a small, highly optimized set of instructions that generally execute in a single clock cycle.

## S

**Sequential Circuit**: A digital circuit whose output depends not only on the present inputs but also on the past inputs, effectively having a memory.

**SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)**: A class of parallel computing where the same operation is performed on multiple data points simultaneously.

**Superscalar**: A CPU design that issues multiple instructions per clock cycle from a sequential instruction stream.

**System Bus**: The main pathway connecting the major components of a computer system, typically consisting of the address bus, data bus, and control bus.

## T

**Thread**: A sequence of instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is part of the operating system.

**Throughput**: The amount of data or instructions that can be processed in a given amount of time.

## V

**Virtual Memory**: A memory management technique that provides an idealized abstraction of the storage resources available to a program, allowing programs to exceed physical memory constraints.

**Von Neumann Architecture**: A computer design where the same memory and bus are used to store both program instructions and data.

## W

**Word**: A fixed-sized group of bits that is handled as a unit by the processor. The word size determines many aspects of the processor's architecture.
