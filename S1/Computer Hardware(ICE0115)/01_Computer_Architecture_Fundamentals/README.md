# Module 1: Computer Architecture Fundamentals

## Overview

This module covers the foundational concepts of computer architecture and organization, primarily based on "Fundamentals of Computer Organization and Architecture" by W. Stallings. Understanding these fundamentals is essential before diving into specific PC components and troubleshooting.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

1. Describe the basic components of computer architecture
2. Explain the Von Neumann architecture and its limitations
3. Understand the differences between CISC and RISC architectures
4. Explain the concepts of buses, addressing modes, and memory hierarchy
5. Describe the fetch-decode-execute cycle
6. Define instruction sets and their characteristics
7. Understand basic digital logic and Boolean algebra as they apply to computer hardware
