# Module 2: PC Components and Systems

## Overview

This module covers the essential components that make up a modern PC system, drawing primarily from "Upgrading and Repairing PCs" by Scott Mueller. Understanding these components and how they work together is fundamental for hardware troubleshooting, system building, and upgrade decisions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

1. Identify all major components in a PC system
2. Understand the function and specifications of each component
3. Explain how components interact with each other
4. Compare different types and specifications of components
5. Make informed decisions about component selection for different use cases
6. Recognize different form factors and compatibility requirements
7. Understand basic electrical and thermal considerations
