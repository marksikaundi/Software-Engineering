# Module 3: Motherboards and BIOS/UEFI

## Overview

This module examines motherboards and BIOS/UEFI systems in detail, building on the foundation from the previous modules. Based primarily on "Upgrading and Repairing PCs" by Scott Mueller, this module provides an in-depth look at the central component that connects all other hardware in a computer system.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

1. Identify different motherboard form factors and their characteristics
2. Understand chipset architecture and functions
3. Explain the purpose and operation of the BIOS/UEFI firmware
4. Interpret motherboard documentation and diagrams
5. Identify all connectors, headers, and slots on a modern motherboard
6. Understand bus architectures and expansion capabilities
7. Troubleshoot common motherboard issues
8. Configure BIOS/UEFI settings appropriately for different scenarios
