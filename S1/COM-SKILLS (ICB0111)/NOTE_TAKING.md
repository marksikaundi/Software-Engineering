# KEY MEANING WITH THEIR USECASES

DENOTATIVE - verb [with object]
be a sign of; indicate: this mark denotes purity and quality.
• stand as a name or symbol for: the level of output per firm is denoted by X.

CANNOTATIVE- (of a word) imply or suggest (an idea or feeling) in addition to the literal or primary meaning: the term ‘modern science’ usually connotes a complete openness to empirical testing.
• (of a fact) imply as a consequence or condition: spinsterhood connoted failure.

## USAGE

Connote does not mean the same as denote. Whereas denote refers to the literal, primary meaning of something, connote refers to other characteristics suggested or implied by that thing. Thus, one might say that a word like mother denotes ‘a woman who is a parent’ but connotes qualities such as protection and affection.
