# Study Guide: Operating Systems (ICE0121)

## 1. Course Overview

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles, design, and implementation of operating systems. You will explore how an OS manages hardware and software resources to provide a stable and efficient computing environment.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the core functions and structure of modern operating systems.
- Analyze the mechanisms for process management, scheduling, and inter-process communication.
- Grasp the challenges of concurrency and the synchronization techniques used to solve them.
- Learn memory management strategies, including virtual memory and paging.
- Understand how file systems are designed and implemented.
- Explore the fundamental concepts of system security and protection.

## 2. Course Structure

The course is divided into six core modules. It is recommended to follow them sequentially, as concepts build upon one another.

| Module | Topic                               | Description                                                                                             |
| :----: | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   1    | **Introduction to Operating Systems** | What an OS is, its history, and its core components (kernel, system calls).                             |
|   2    | **Process Management**              | Processes, threads, CPU scheduling algorithms, and inter-process communication (IPC).                     |
|   3    | **Memory Management**               | Memory allocation techniques (segmentation, paging), virtual memory, and page replacement algorithms.   |
|   4    | **Storage and File Systems**        | File system interfaces and implementation, disk structure, and directory management.                    |
|   5    | **Concurrency and Synchronization** | The challenge of race conditions, critical sections, and synchronization primitives (mutexes, semaphores). |
|   6    | **System Security**                 | Security threats, protection mechanisms, access control, and basic cryptography.                        |

## 3. Recommended Study Approach

1.  **Weekly Reading:** Start each week by reading the notes for the corresponding module.
2.  **Review Key Concepts:** Use the `Key_Concepts.md` and `Glossary.md` in the `Resources` folder to solidify your understanding of important terminology.
3.  **Self-Assessment:** At the end of each module, attempt the `Practice_Questions.md` to test your knowledge and identify areas for improvement.
4.  **Practical Exploration:** If possible, try to find practical examples of these concepts in your own operating system (e.g., observing processes in Task Manager/Activity Monitor, exploring the file system).
