# Resource: Glossary of Terms

- **Address Space:** The range of memory addresses that a process can access.
- **API (Application Programming Interface):** A set of functions and procedures allowing the creation of applications that access the features or data of an operating system, application, or other service.
- **Concurrency:** The ability of different parts or units of a program, algorithm, or problem to be executed out-of-order or in partial order without affecting the final outcome.
- **Context Switch:** The process of storing the state of a process or thread, so that it can be restored and resume execution at a later point.
- **Deadlock:** A situation where two or more competing actions are waiting for the other to finish, and thus neither ever does.
- **Fragmentation (External/Internal):** Wasted memory. External fragmentation means there is enough total memory, but it is not contiguous. Internal fragmentation means there is unused memory within an allocated block.
- **Kernel:** The core component of an operating system. It manages the system's resources and is the bridge between hardware and software.
- **Mutex (Mutual Exclusion):** A synchronization primitive that grants exclusive access to a shared resource to only one thread at a time.
- **Process:** An instance of a computer program that is being executed.
- **Race Condition:** A behavior where the output of a process depends on the sequence or timing of other uncontrollable events.
- **Scheduler:** The part of the OS that decides which process to run next.
- **Semaphore:** A variable or abstract data type used to control access to a common resource by multiple processes in a concurrent system.
- **System Call:** The programmatic way in which a computer program requests a service from the kernel of the operating system it is executed on.
- **Thread:** The smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler.
- **Virtual Memory:** A memory management capability of an OS that uses hardware and software to allow a computer to compensate for physical memory shortages by temporarily transferring data from random access memory (RAM) to disk storage.
