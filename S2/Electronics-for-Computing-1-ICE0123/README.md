# Study Guide: Electronics for Computing 1 (ICE0123)

## 1. Course Overview

This course introduces the fundamental electronic principles and components that form the backbone of modern computers and digital devices. You will explore everything from basic electrical concepts to the logic gates that power computation.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand basic electrical quantities: voltage, current, and resistance.
- Analyze simple circuits using fundamental laws like Ohm's Law and Kirchhoff's Laws.
- Learn how semiconductor devices like diodes and transistors work.
- Understand the principles of digital logic, including Boolean algebra and logic gates.
- Gain a practical understanding of how electronic circuits are used to process and store information.

## 2. Course Structure

The course is divided into five core modules. A strong foundation in the early modules is crucial for understanding the later topics.

| Module | Topic                         | Description                                                                                               |
| :----: | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   1    | **Fundamental Concepts**      | Basic electrical quantities (Voltage, Current, Resistance) and Ohm's Law.                                   |
|   2    | **Semiconductors and Diodes** | Introduction to semiconductor physics, P-N junctions, and the behavior of diodes.                         |
|   3    | **Transistors**               | The structure and operation of Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs) and MOSFETs as switches and amplifiers.  |
|   4    | **Digital Logic**             | Binary number systems, Boolean algebra, and the implementation of logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR).          |
|   5    | **Circuit Analysis**          | Introduction to Kirchhoff's Laws and techniques for analyzing series and parallel circuits.                 |

## 3. Recommended Study Approach

1.  **Grasp the Fundamentals:** Spend extra time on Module 1. A solid understanding of Voltage, Current, and Resistance is absolutely essential.
2.  **Visualize Concepts:** Electronics can be abstract. Use diagrams and visualizations in the notes to understand component behavior and current flow.
3.  **Work Through Problems:** Use the `Practice_Questions.md` and `Formula_Sheet.md` to actively solve problems. Electronics is a subject learned by doing.
4.  **Connect to Computing:** Always try to link the concepts back to the main goal: understanding how computers work. For example, see a transistor not just as a component, but as the fundamental building block of a CPU—a switch.
